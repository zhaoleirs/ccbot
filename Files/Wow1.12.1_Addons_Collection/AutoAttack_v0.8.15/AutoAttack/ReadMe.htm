	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Intro:</FONT><BR><B>AutoAttack</B>
	is a WoW add-on for automatically selecting the next combat action.
	I play characters of every class, which makes it hard to remember
	the appropriate combat actions when switching characters, especially
	if I haven't played it in a while. When repeatedly killing mobs for
	quests, it also gets tedious thinking about the sequence of actions
	to take. So after modifying LazyRogue for another player, I decided
	to write a similar mod that could be used for any class.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Installing:</FONT><BR>Just
	unzip <B>AutoAttack</B> into your &quot;<FONT COLOR="#ffff00">World
	of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns</FONT>&quot; folder. You can create the
	sub-folders if they don't already exist.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Configuration:</FONT><BR>Minimal
	configuration is required as <B>AutoAttack</B> automatically checks
	the available ActionBar actions when logging on. Only actions that
	show up on at least one of your ActionBars will be use (it doesn't
	have to be a visible one). If you don't want an action to be used,
	you can disable it with the '<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">/aause</FONT></FONT>'
	command. <I>Warning</I>: If you don't have an Attack action on your
	ActionBars, there won't be any default melee attack action! When you
	change your ActionBars (like when you level and train new actions),
	you must use the '<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">/aa
	scan</FONT></FONT>' command for the changes to be recognized.<BR><BR>The
	only required configuration is to go to the <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Main
	Menu</FONT>, select <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Key Bindings</FONT> and
	assign a key to the <B>AutoAttack</B> 'Perform combat action'
	command (it will be near the bottom of the list after all the
	standard commands). I use the Backspace key and the mouse 'scroll
	left' button as I find them the most convenient to use. There is
	also an alternate 'instant' key binding that can be used to modify
	the action selection for different situations (typically favoring
	melee or group actions).<BR><BR>You can also assign keys to the
	commands to switch mount and form. These may not be useful for some
	characters and are just provided as a convenience. They are not
	needed for combat actions.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Action
	Use:</FONT><BR>Each time you press the 'action' key (as defined in
	<FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Key Bindings</FONT>), <B>AutoAttack</B> will
	select the next action to be performed. Only one action will be made
	for each key press due to a Blizzard restriction on actions to
	prevent automated play while AFK. If a suitable action can't be
	found, no action will be taken. The particular action selected will
	depend on the character class and the combat conditions. Note that
	addons can't move the player around or chase targets.<BR><BR>The
	'instant' action will typically favor instant cast spells and melee
	action, but is detailed for each class.<BR><BR>When not in combat
	and with no target selected, only pre-combat buff and healing
	actions are selected. When a friendly target is selected, healing
	and buffs can be applied to the target. When an attackable target is
	selected out of combat, pre-combat buffs are checked first and then
	an attack is initiated if the target is within range.<BR><BR>Once in
	combat, the action selected depends on the actions available, the
	target range, the target type and the health of both the player and
	the target. Buffs will be maintained where practical and healing
	spells used if needed and available. When still in combat after a
	kill, Hunters and Warlocks will select their pet's target. If a
	target is immune to an action, it will be remembered until logout
	and not used again on targets with the same name. Use the '<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">/aa
	immune</FONT></FONT>' command to display detected immunities.<BR><BR>Refer
	to the class action sections for class specific actions. Several
	classes can use some actions more effectively when the addon
	<FONT COLOR="#ffff00">MobHealth</FONT> is also loaded. <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">AutoSelect</FONT>
	also works well with this addon.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Class
	Actions</FONT><BR>Each class has a set of actions defined in the
	localization file. Actions will only be used if they appear on the
	ActionBars. Lower level characters will have fewer available actions
	but will still make good use of the limited selection. Some
	specialized actions like AoE spells are not used because selection
	logic can't determine the appropriate time to use them, so these
	should be activated manually when needed. A wand will be activated
	with Mages, Priests and Warlocks if mana drops below 20% and will be
	deactivated when the next action is attempted.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Druid:</FONT>
	Each druid combat form has its own action selection logic:<BR><U>Spells</U>:
	Mark and Thorn buffs are used. Starfire or Wrath is used to initiate
	combat. Moonfire DoT is maintained on the target. If health drops
	below 90%, Rejuvination is used and below 60% a heal is used. Melee
	attacks will be used if the target is in melee range and it will be
	debuffed with Faerie Fire.<BR><BR>Use: Self buffs are applied first
	and then friendly targets are buffed. To maximize target damage,
	start the next action just as the current action completes. As the
	target enters melee range, the next action will initiate a melee
	attack in addition to casting. When the target initiates the attack,
	Moonfire will be the first spell used.<BR><BR>Instant: When not in
	combat, Roots will not be used. In combat, only instant cast spells
	will be used so when ranged, Moonfire will be repeatedly cast (good
	for killing retreating targets).<BR><BR><U>Bear</U>: Enrage is used
	to prebuff when a target is selected but not in combat. A Roar
	debuff is maintained. Maul is the default action. If spell casting
	is detected, Bash is used. If health drops below 15%, Frenzied
	Regeneration is used.<BR><BR>Use: To use Enrage, selected a target
	and use action outside of melee range. Swipe isn't used as multiple
	attackers can't be determined.<BR><BR><U>Cat</U>: Prowl is used if
	there isn't a target in melee range. Ravage or Shred is used to
	initiate combat. Rake and Fury are used when available and Claw is
	the default. Rip is used as a finishing combo move.<BR><BR>Use: Use
	action before selecting a target to Prowl. When you are initiating
	combat, it is assumed that you are behind your target. Ravage will
	be attempted in stealth and Shred when not.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4><FONT SIZE=4>Hunter</FONT>:</FONT>
	The Hawk aspect is selected if available and Monkey isn't already
	selected. A pet is called if not active or revived if found to be
	dead. The target is Marked and the pet attack is activated. If no
	pet is available, a Concussive Shot is used, otherwise a Serpent
	Sting or Aimed Shot is used unless the target uses mana, in which
	case a Viper Sting is used. Arcane Shot is used when available. Auto
	Shot is the default ranged action. In melee range, Raptor Strike is
	used. If health drops below 10%, Feign Death is used. If pet health
	drops below 30%, Mend Pet is used. Note: Aimed Shot lacks animation,
	so a click sound is used to indicate that it is in progress.<BR><BR>Pet
	Feeding: You pet can be automatically fed when not happy. In order
	for this to work, you must first select the inventory slot where the
	pet's food is located by positioning the cursor over the food and
	entering the command '<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">/aafeed</FONT></FONT>'.
	If the slot becomes empty a warning is given and you can either move
	food to that slot or select a different slot. While a pet is
	feeding, an attack won't be started.<BR><BR>Use: Aspect of the Hawk
	is used in ranged combat and Aspect of the Monkey in melee, but if
	Aspect of the Wild is manually selected, it won't be replaced. If
	Call Pet warns of a dead pet, Revive Pet will be used. Any target
	that isn't in melee range will be marked first. A pet attack will be
	initiated before the first shot unless the pet is already fighting.
	If your pet has a target and you don't, your pet's target will be
	used. When a pet dies, revival isn't attempted while fighting, but a
	target must be selected before a call/revive check is made.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Mage:</FONT>
	Frost/Ice Armor and Arcane Intellect buffs are used. Food, water and
	a mana gem will be conjured if usable. Frostbolt is used to initiate
	combat except with targets using mana, when Pyroblast or Fireball is
	used. If spell casting is detected, Counterspell is used. Arcane
	Missiles is the normal attack with Fireball and Frostbolt as backup.
	Fire Blast is used in melee range, with Cone of Cold as a backup
	when health is below 50%. If mana drops below 15% and a mana gem is
	available, it will be used.<BR><BR>Use: Self buffs are applied first
	and then friendly targets are buffed. To maximize target damage,
	start the next action just as the current action completes. As the
	target enters melee range, the next action will initiate a melee
	attack in addition to casting and if mana is over 50% or health is
	under 20% the Mana Shield will be used. Food and Water can be
	conjured and will be used out of combat if health or mana is below
	60% (the actions and the conjured items must be on the ActionBars).
	<BR><BR>Instant: In melee combat, only instant cast spells will be
	used.<BR><BR><I>Warnings</I>: If both Frost and Ice Armor appear on
	your ActionBars, the last one found will be used unless you disable
	one. If you have more than one type of conjure food, water or mana
	gem on your ActionBars, you can get stuck on the conjuring
	action!<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Paladin:</FONT> The Blessing of Might
	buff is used, but the Aura selection isn't changed. Exorcism is used
	on Undead and Demon targets. When available. Seal of Light is used
	on both the player and the target. If spell casting is detected,
	Hammer of Justice is used. If player health drops below 50%, Holy
	Light is used. When health drops below 20%, Divine Shield, Divine
	Protection or Blessing of Protection will be used.<BR><BR>Use: Make
	sure you have an Aura active and activate your buff before entering
	combat. After selecting a target do 1 action to activate your Seal,
	then when you are in melee range, do 2 actions (use Judgement,
	reactive Seal). Melee combat will proceed without actions, but use
	action as needed to maintain buffs and heal. After a kill, start the
	next attack while your Seal is still active to save reactivating
	it.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Priest:</FONT> Fortitude and Inner Fire
	buffs are used. Holy Fire, Mind Blast and Smite are the main attacks
	and the DoT debuff Shadow Word: Pain is maintained. If player health
	drops below 85%, Renew is used and below 55% with a Shield, Heal is
	used. When the target is a player or in melee with less that 50%
	health, Psychic Scream is used followed by Mind Flay. When
	available, Inner Focus is used to reduce the mana cost of Shield and
	Heal spells. If spell casting is detected, Silence is used. <BR><BR>Use:
	Self buffs are applied first and then friendly targets are buffed.
	When a target is selected outside of casting range, Shield will be
	used first, otherwise Shield won't be cast until the Pain debuff is
	active (if available). As the target enters melee range, the next
	action will initiate a melee attack in addition to casting. When the
	target attacks first, Pain will be the first action and Shield the
	second. To maximize target damage, start the next action just as the
	current action completes.<BR><BR>Instant: Burn Mana will not be used
	to start combat.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Rogue:</FONT> Stealth is used
	if no target is selected. When the target is ranged, Shoot/Throw is
	used. To initiate combat in melee range, Garrote, Backstab or Stun
	is used. Riposte and Ghostly Strike are used when available.
	Sinister Strike is the default action. Evasion is used if health
	drops below 50% and Gouge below 30%. If spell casting is detected,
	Kick or Gouge is used. Eviscerate is used when combo points are
	complete or when it is estimated that it would kill the target.
	<BR><BR>Use: Use action before selecting a target to enter stealth.
	If you don't want to use a ranged attack, be sure that you are in
	melee range before using action when a target is selected. When you
	are initiating combat, it is assumed that you are behind your
	target. Garrote will be attempted in stealth and Backstab when
	not.<BR><BR>Instant: When not in combat, indicates a frontal attack
	instead of the usual rear attack. In combat, indicates using a
	Backstab from behind (typically used in a group when the target is
	attacking another player). <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Shaman:</FONT>
	Lightning Shield and Rockbiter Weapon buffs are used. Lightning Bolt
	is the main ranged attack and isn't used in melee. When in range,
	Flame shock is used if the target is over 50% health, otherwise
	Frost Shock or Earth Shock will be used. In melee, the Stoneskin
	Totem will be used and if the target is close to the player in
	difficulty, the Searing Totem will be used. If health drops below
	50%, Healing Wave is used. <BR><BR>Use: In or out of combat, buffs
	are maintained and healing used on low health. Lightning Bolt is
	used whenever the target is outside of melee range. The presence of
	a Searing Totem isn't detected, so it won't be recast until at least
	40 seconds have passed. Magma and Fire Nova totems and Chain
	Lightning aren't used because multiple attackers can't be
	determined.<BR><BR>Instant: In melee combat, only instant cast
	spells will be used.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Warlock:</FONT> The Demon
	Skin/Armor buff is used. The minion is used to initiate the attack
	(must be summoned first). If the next action occurs before the
	minion engages the target, Immolate will be cast. Corruption, Siphon
	Life and Immolate are maintained on the target. If the player mana
	is below 70% and health is above 90%, Life Tap will be used. In
	melee combat Curse of Weakness replaces Curse of Agony and if player
	health drops below 70% Death Coil and Drain Life will be used. Curse
	of Agony and Immolate will be used as long as the target has over
	20% health. If the target uses mana and has over 15%, Drain Mana
	will be used. Shadow Bolt is the default action.<BR><BR>Use: Summon
	your minion before using actions. The pet attack is the first combat
	action unless the pet already has a target. The Pet's target will be
	used if the player doesn't have one. Immolate will be the first
	spell cast only if you aren't already in combat, otherwise it will
	be cast after Corruption, Curse of Agony, Siphon Life. In melee
	range, Curse of Weakness will be used if Curse of Agony isn't active
	and visa-versa. If mana drops below 70% and health is above 90%,
	Life Tap will be used to exchange health for mana.<BR><BR>Instant:
	Shadow Bolt will not be used.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Warrior:</FONT>
	Charge is used to initiate combat (when possible). Heroic Strike is
	the default attack. Battle Shout is the only buff used. The Rend
	debuff is maintained. Overpower, Disarm, Revenge and Sunder Armor
	are used when available. If spell casting is detected, Shield Bash
	is attempted. Execute is used for finishing a kill. For humanoid
	opponents, Hamstring is used to slow retreats when their health
	drops below 50%. Intimidating Shout is used if player health drops
	below 20%.<BR><BR>Use: Select a target out of melee range and Charge
	will be the first action if close enough. When out of melee range
	and Charge fails, Shooting will be attempted. When not in combat
	with a target and beyond shooting range, Bloodrage is used.
	Multi-target actions aren't used because multiple attackers can't be
	determined.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-right: 0.3in"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4>Mount/Form
	switching:</FONT><BR>The 'mount' and 'form' commands provide context
	switching. Unless your character has BOTH a mount and an alternate
	form, the two commands will have the same effect. If you are mounted
	or are using an alternate form (mainly druids), either command will
	cancel the mount or form status and record the mount or form that
	was in use.<BR><BR>As it is possible to have multiple mounts,
	<B>AutoAttack</B> requires that the mount action be on a hotkey and
	that the switch key be used to dismount from the desired mount. Once
	it has been recorded, it will be saved between logins and used for
	the next mount request. To select a different mount, manually
	activate the new mount and then use the switch key to
	dismount.<BR><BR>Only druids have multiple forms available. Shaman
	have a travel form and the hunter Aspect of the Cheetah/Pack is
	treated as a form. Like mounts, the switch key must be used to
	disable the form to record it before it can be activated with the
	switch key. The last druid form switched out of will be the next one
	switched into. To change the recorded form, manually select a
	different one.</FONT></P>
