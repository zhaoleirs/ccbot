--[[  Instruction for localisation:
If you'd like to help localising BGSoundAlerts to your language, first find your section.
Then, start translating each string (every string is enclosed withen double inverted commas) to your client's locale.
Make sure that wherever "Alliance" or "Horde" appears, "Alliance"/"Horde" also appears in the translated string.
When you're finished, send this file by PM on wowui.incgamers.com to Klishu.

Thank you very much for your help. Don't forget to add your name in the appropriate BGS_S_LOADED string!
