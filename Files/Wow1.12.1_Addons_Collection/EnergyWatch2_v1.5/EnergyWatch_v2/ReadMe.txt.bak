Watching UNIT_ENERGY event. This will fix the problem with 
energy not correctly getting set on load. 
Removed the Event for UNIT_MANA. This is not need since we
are using UNIT_ENERGY.
You can now have your combo points shown on the energy bar. 
I find this extremely useful. When doing the text replacement 
use &c. For example, to show a text of Energy with combo points 
and Current Energy you could do.
/ew text Energy (&c) &e. At 100 energy and 2 combo points this would be 
Energy (2) 100
