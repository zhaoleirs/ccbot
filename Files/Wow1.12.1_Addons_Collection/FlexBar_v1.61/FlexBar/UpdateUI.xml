From the docs:

Getting Started with FlexBar

Introduction:  Flexbar provides 120 buttons that can be moved, scaled, shaded, hidden, shown and alpha blended completely independently of one another.  This allows you to put just as many buttons as you need, just where you need.

In additon to basic extra bar functionality, FlexBar employs an event (think trigger) / action (command) architecture.  It is constantly keeping track of the status of a wide number of things from your buffs to your health to whether you have a target or not.  When it detects a change in these it raise an event that you can have a command respond to - such as showing your overpower button when your opponent dodges.

And much more - please see the FlexBar Docs/_Table of Contents_.htm in the FlexBar folder</Description>
