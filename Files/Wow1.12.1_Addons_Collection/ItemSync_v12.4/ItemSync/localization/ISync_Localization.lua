	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFWhy did all my items become invalid all of a sudden?|r\n\nBecause the server restarted either after maintenance or from a patch.  Each time the server is restarted the itemID's that are stored on server get refreshed.  This means that all your items or I should say most become invalid because they no longer match those on the server.\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\nIn order for those items to become valid again.  The person with the original item has to logon to the server and upload their itemcache.

	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFCan I search for items using a slash command?|r\n\nYes you can!  Just use any of the slash commands your familiar with for ItemSync and use the search command to it.  \n\nExample: /is search itemname\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFDoes ItemSync have any hotkeys?|r\n\nYes you can setup hotkeys to open both the main window and the bag view.\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFHow does invalid parsing work?|r\n\nIt's simple each time an item is found it is matched between the valid list and the invalid list.  If it's in the valid list already then it's ignored.  However if it's in the invalid list then it gets removed from the invalid list and put into the valid list.  Everytime you open the main window";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.." all the invalid items get checked.  There is a function that tries to play around with invalid itemid's to see if it can make it valid.  If the function can make it valid then it removes it from the invalid database and puts it into the valid database.  NOTE: It -MAY- not be the exact item it was before but at least that's one more valid item you have then invalid.";

	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFWhy do I have duplicate items and how do I get rid of it?|r\n\nSomehow when certain items get processed their names change because of different itemid's then that one that is stored.  When this happens you get duplicated items.  This doesn't ALWAYS happen but once in awhile it does.  If you want to cleanup your database just use the purge duplicate item ability in the filters panel.\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFCan I force invalid items to work?|r\n\nYou won't be able to unless you haxxored ItemSync.  If you did then don't come to me if you keep getting disconnected or worse crash.\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFWhy doesn't a certain mod work with ItemSync?|r\n\nBecause that author never included ItemSync support in their mod.  Please alert -THEM- not -ME- that you want them to support ItemSync.  I will only add support for a mod if it's extremely important.\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFGosh your a great guy and I want to give you my thanks?|r\n\nYou can thank me by sharing how you feel about ItemSync with your friends.  It's the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFWhy do I disconnect when I use the ItemID lookup?|r\n\nThis tool has no support and you USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  If you are disconnected the creator of ItemSync is not responsible.  The reason you may disconnect is because that item may not be in your LOCAL item cache or the SERVE hasn't ever seen it yet.  When this happens you get disconnected.  Once again ItemSync is not responsible for any disconnections.  You have been warned!\n\n";
	ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC = ISYNC_HELPPANEL_DESC.."\n|c00FFFFFFHow can I add items while I type?|r\n\nIt's simple just type it out within brackets as you go.  So if you type [copper bar] it will replace it with the actual link.
