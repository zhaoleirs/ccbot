Select the icon style you want to use for your note.\n2. Title: Enter it in the editbox and select a color in which it will bedisplayed in the tooltip.\nNOTE: The title field is mandatory, you cannot create a note without a title - to prevent this the 'Save' button is disabled when the title field is empty.\n3. Infoline 1 and 2: Here you can insert additional information for your note and color it in one of the colors below the editbox.\n4. Creator: Enter the name of the player or AddOn that created the note.\n\nThe MiniNote:\nA MiniNote is a note placed on the MiniMap. Moving the mouse over the MiniNote shows the details of the note. To show one of your notes on the MiniMap go to the Worldmap, left click on a note and choose 'Set As MiniNote'. To hide the note on the MiniMap, you can go to the WorldMap, left click and choose 'Turn MiniNote Off'.\n\nThe MiniNote is turned off if the MapNote corresponding to it is deleted.\n\nSend Notes To Other Players:\nAfter clicking 'Send Note' in the notes Menu the Send Menu will show up.\n\n1. Enter the name of the player you want to send a note to.\n   NOTE: Targeting the player before opening the WorldMap will auto insert the name.\n\n2. Send To Player\n   Choose this option to send the note to the player entered above.\n\n3. Send To Party\n   This will send the note to the entire party. (No player name needs to be filled in).\n\n4. Change Mode\n   This toggles between Send To Player/Send To Party and Get Slash Command).\n\n5. Get Slash Command\n   Inserts a slash command in the editbox which can be highlighted and then copied to the clipboard.  After this you can post it on a forum or in chat and other MetaMap or MapNotes users can insert this note by copying the slash command to the chatline.\n\nSlash Commands:\n\n/nextmininote [on|off], /nmn [on|off]\nShows the next note created (using any method) as a MiniNote and also puts it on the WorldMap. If invoked with no parameters, it will toggle the current state.\n\n/nextmininoteonly [on|off], /nmno [on|off]\nLike the previous command, but doesn't put the note on the WorldMap.\n\n/mininoteoff, /mno\nTurns the MiniNote off.\n\n/quicknote [m] [xx,yy] [name], /qnote [m] [xx,yy] [name]\nSets a note on the map in your current zone. The optional [m] parameter will set a mode for the note.\n1 = Set as Note + Mininote\n2 = Set as Mininote only\n3 = Set as a vNote (Virtual Note)\n\nNo parameter or any other number for [m] will set as map note only.
