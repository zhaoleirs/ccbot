</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId329699"></a>Known Issues: </h3>









<ul>








  <li>Group Buffs added in 4.1B(01) need some more work.<br />


	1. Fix single attempting to overwite group buff error<br />


	2. Add counts so it only casts when sufficient players are in range<br />

	</li>


  <li>Panza will not overwrite existing Priest buffs on targets
outside
your party/raid. We will add level-checking, and overwrite ability asap.</li>









  <li>If the MiniMap button is not visible, or is over another
button, use the
command line "/panza config" command and move the button's position
with the
slider. This position is saved between logins. If your MiniMap is full
of
buttons, you can disable PA's.&nbsp; There is a binding included
for key
press access to the GUI if that is preferred over the button.</li>









  <li>If a member of your party or raid is not nearby when the
Cycle selects them, PA will
skip over this member and move on. The Cycle will not end until
everyone has been blessed,
or you cancel it with Alt+Cyclebless. This is not an issue. It was
designed this way.</li>









  <li>If CycleBless hangs, or causes continuous nil errors, reset
it with
alt+cyclebless. A cycle reset will usually clear any condition causing
nil
errors.</li>









</ul>



<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId221306"></a>Bugs</h3>


<p>
If you find a bug, such as a nil error or incorrectly applied buff then please:</p>



<ol>



  <li>Ensure you have the latest version from <a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1042">ui.worldofwar.net</a></li>



  <li>Post a comment there or email us on <a href="mailto:wow-pa-devs@lists.sourceforge.net">PADevs</a></li>



  <li>type /pa dump at a point you are confident the issue will reproduce (e.g. hitting the Cycle macro and nothing happens)</li>



  <li>logout</li>



  <li>send us the Panza.lua from the directory it informs you of<br />



  </li>



</ol>


<p>
(actually
you don't need to logout immediately, just send when it's convenient.
However you do need to logout before you send the file or the values
are not written to disk) </p>



<br />


<p>
These dump files give us your full settings and current state. They
allow us to reproduce most issues in a controlled, repeatable
environment. They will be fed into our unit tests and help protect
against regression.





</p>


<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId375033"></a>In the works.</h3>









<ul>









  <li>Please See the <a href="to-do.txt">to-do.txt</a>
file for the latest information on
upcoming changes. Items near the top of this list will be added in the
current beta over time.</li>

2006-07<small><br />









For Version 4.1</small></h2>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId273932"></a>Installation</h3>









<p> This Addon is for the WoW Healer/Buffer classes. This Addon installs
in
\Interface\AddOns\Panza. Make sure the Panza Addon is checked (enabled)
in the Addons Dialog from the main character selection screen. The
Addons button will be in the lower left of the
screen. If you are upgrading from Paladin Assistant then you must delete the old directory \Interface\AddOns\PaladinAssistant. </p>









<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId900001"></a> Installation Options</h4>









<p>Panza works best if installed along with
<a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1442">Titan
Panel</a>, and
<a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1461">BonusScanner</a>
Addons. These
two Addons are required if you desire to have PA's healing functions
utilize any
+healing gear you have invested in. PA will automatically detect if
BonusScanner
is installed and query it's data for the +healing value. Titan Panel is
a requirement
for the TitanPA Plug-in.&nbsp; </p>









<p>Panza has also been developed to register with the
<a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=222">MyAddons</a>
Addon Manager v2.5.
A help system within MyAddons will be utilized in the future.</p>









<p>Panza Includes the <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=1305">
MapLibrary</a>
Function Library Addon v1.1.4.&nbsp; This Addon's functions can be
used
for range calculations. The function library is enabled by default.
Note that using Action Bars for Range checking is the recommended
method, and MapLibrary will be used if Action Bars are not utilized.</p>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId90878"></a>Introduction</h3>









<p> After you select your character, a message should appear in
the
middle of the screen&nbsp;announcing the Addon has loaded, and what
the version is. A message will also appear in the chat window that says
"Panza
v4.1. Use /panza or /pa for commands."&nbsp; The interface to Panza
functions is through the use of Macros built to use the commands, the
command line interface itself,
and the GUI.&nbsp; Type "/pa show" (without the ") and press
enter.&nbsp; A brief series of Messages will appear showing the
current
settings for Panza.
The PA Minimap icon is a hammer. Click the hammer to bring up the main
options
GUI. If you cannot see the hammer, use /pa config, and move the minimap
button
with the slide bar control. The Main dialog has
checkboxes for all global settings, and push buttons to access PA's
sub-systems. </p>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId960282"></a>Features</h3>









<ul>









  <li>Panza helps Healers, and Buffers with Buff/Blessing, Healing, and Cure
duties. </li>









  <li>The buffing code will select the correct rank of spell
based on the target's
level. It will also cast specific buffs based on the class of your
target,
called AutoBless.</li>













  <li>You can save specific buffs for players and use that
setting instead of the
class default when auto or cycle buff.</li>













  <li>You can cycle through Party or Raid groups, and AutoBuff
everyone without
actively switching targets even once.</li>













  <li>You can cycle through nearby players and AutoBuff everyone
in range.</li>













  <li>The Healing engine will detect who in the party or raid
group needs healing
(currently based on lowest ratio of health) and cast a spell that
should not
over-heal the target. All Healing controls are in <span style="font-weight: bold;">PHM</span></li>













  <li>You can target a specific player and use the spell and rank
selection logic for healing (BestHeal).</li>













  <li>You can use <span style="font-weight: bold;">PMM</span> mouse click functions on various Frames
(see <span style="font-weight: bold;">PMM</span>) to heal, buff, cure, etc.</li>













  <li>The Healing engine will detect Blessing of Light on the
Target, Divine
Favor, Amplify Magic, and the +Healing bonus from gear used, and use
the extra
healing points gained from these when selecting the healing spell rank.</li>













  <li>The Healing engine has a configurable mana threshold where
all healing spells will switch to low-mana "Flash" spells.
The default for this parameter is 10%. </li>













  <li>The Healing engine also has a configurable health threshold
where low HP gain spells will be used (i.e. top off).
The default for this parameter is 70%. Any target with this health
ratio, or
above will receive "Flash" spells.</li>













  <li>The Healing engine is also adjustable via a slide bar that
can tune the
engine between under-healing to over-healing within a +-5 rank range.
This
can be used to tune the engine for bonuses and debuffs that are not
automatically accounted for. This adjustment is made post automatic
rank
selection as a final adjustment. The default is 0 (middle of the bar).</li>









  <li>The Healing engine will warn you to abort spells if it
detects
the target has reached the
Over-heal Threshold (<span style="font-weight: bold;">PHM</span>). You can start to cast a new healing spell,
and the current one will abort. There is also an abort key on the
Current Heal status bar that can also be used to abort the spell.</li>









  <li>A special Divine Intervention Macro that will calculate who
the closest
alive healer is, and cast Divine Intervention on them (Paladin Only
Feature). This function will prefer
other Paladins first, Priests next, then Druids. This feature will also
announce
this action to either the Raid Group, or Party.</li>









  <li>You can heal outside a Party/Raid group. Panza will
estimate the target's Hit Points.</li>









  <li>The curing code will detect Poison, Disease,&nbsp;Magic and Curses, and
use the correct spell to cure.</li>









  <li>You can cast healing, buffs, and cure spells without
switching targets. </li>









  <li>Spell casting Announcement via party/raid chat, say, emote,
and/or direct whispers to the target.</li>









  <li>If you need to resurrect someone, Panza will check the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRA</span> Rez
Monitor, and skip players being raised by someone else.</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId427062"></a>Basic Macros</h3>









<p>Panza contains a Macros button in the main dialog.&nbsp;
This
button will create all of the main macros needed to use Panza
functions.&nbsp; All
that is required, is for you to drag the macros to a hotbar! The Macro text
will update automatically when you learn new ranks of that spell.</p>









<p>You may also use the features of Panza by creating you own macros.
To access the Macro screen in <span style="font-weight: bold;">WoW</span>, press Escape, and Select Macros.
Pick a Icon and name for the Macro. In the commands window put the
/panza
(or /pa) command <command> in there. Note that depending on your
level, some of the commands may not work because you do not yet have
the spells. <a href="#Commands">Here is a list of commands</a>.</command><br />





</p>






<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId482453"></a>Key Binds</h3>
Most of Panza's fuctions can also be activated via a keybind. To set a
keybind hit the ESC key the choose Keybinds, then scroll down to the
Panza keybinds. <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Warning: do not set a Panza keybind to use the ALT or CTRL key as this will cause many things to break.</span>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId627748"></a>Healing (PHM)</h3>




Healing is a core component of Panza. The sophisticated healing engine
can choose the most appropriate player to heal and cast the best
healing spell dependent on the target's health and the caster's mana.
The criteria for these decisions make up the bulk of the healing
settings and include:<br />



<br />



<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId574862"></a>Target Selection Settings</h4>


TBD
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId131235"></a>Healing Spell Choice Settings</h4>


TBD






<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId980686"></a>AutoSelect Heal (Heal) Macro</h4>









<p>There is a macro created called "Heal". Panza will pick a
target and
heal with the lowest rank spell it can.
By default if you are at least level 20, and have purchased at least
the "Flash" Rank 1 spell, and your health is above 70%,
a Flash spell should be cast on you (without you switching targets off
your enemy). Heal does nothing but select a target to heal.
The function BestHeal (see below) is the core healing engine.
In a party, or raid, Heal will pick the party member with the lowest
ratio of health remaining (current health / health max)
below the Minimum Health Threshold. Sometimes you may feel that Panza
did not make the "right" choice,
so keep the BestHeal function handy, and also a few direct spells
nearby. You can use this Macro in Solo mode without having to press
alt.
When you are solo, this Addon considers you a party of 1.</p>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId647387"></a>BestHeal (Best) Macro</h4>









<p>Go find someone fighting something. Target this player, and
press
the "Best" macro button.
Panza will estimate the target's Hit Points, and cast the most efficient
spell it can to heal them up.
Note that the "Heal" function uses "Best" to do it's healing after it
has picked the target.
There are many configurable parameters that control "Best". These
Parameters are in PHM.
BestHeal will automatically reduce the spell rank if mana drops below
the minimum it would take to cast whatever spell it originally
selected.
</p>









<p>
BestHeal will detect Blessing of Light, Amplify Magic, Divine Favor, a
slew of Debuffs,
+Healing, and uses the added healing bonuses to aid in rank selection
(reducing mana costs).
You can also use this macro with the alt+macro key press, and heal
yourself (without switching targets).</p>




<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId228023"></a><a name="Buffing"></a>Buffing (PBM)</h3>



Buffing is a another core component of Panza. Panza can select the most
appropriate buff for a target according to the target's class and
current buffs from other sources. Buffs are remembered and warnings can
be issued when they are about to expire. There is also a cycle mode
that will apply buffs to all members of a party/raid and reapply them
as required.<br />









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId88516"></a>Blessing Modes</h4>









<p>There are three modes of operation for every Buff Macro.
Normal,
Self, and Saved. The normal mode is target and click. This will cast
the selected blessing, at the computed rank, on your target target.
Normal mode also has four sub-modes. These are "Solo", "Party", "Raid",
and "BattleGround".
Panza will detect the sub-mode automatically. If your target is solo,
"Solo"
will be used, in a Raid Group, "Raid" will be used, and finally if the
target is in your Party, the "Party"
setting will be used. The order of buff selection is Saved, then Party,
then BattleGround, then Raid, then Solo.</p>









<p>The Self mode is activated by pressing Alt+macro button. This
will
direct Panza to cast the selected buff on you. The same rules apply to
the Self Mode as far as sub-mode goes. For instance If you are in a
Raid, the Raid-Group blessing will be used by default. What blessings
that are defined as default is determined by what spells you have in
your spell book. If you have Blessing of Salvation, this spell will be
the default on most classes
for Party. Warriors get Blessing of Might in all cases. Paladins get
Might when solo, but Wisdom when in groups (The typical Healadin
setting).</p>









<p>Saved mode is activated by pressing control+macro button. This
will
direct Panza to save this blessing for this player. After the blessing
selection is saved for this player, any time an autobless function
(autobless, cyclenear, and cyclebless) is used on them, the saved
blessing will be used instead of the default. Saved blessings override
everything else. Including what you may have changed in DCB.
See the Blessing List section later for more information on saved
blessings.</p>









<p>You cannot combine modes. For instance you cannot invoke the
Self-Buff with
alt+, and save it with ctrl+ at the same time. This operation is
undefined. One
or the other will take priority. To save your own unique blessing,
target
nobody, and use the control+macro blessing. </p>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId500333"></a>Default Class Buffs (DCB)</h4>









<p>Default Buffs are managed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span> editor. This editor is
accessed
from the main dialog by pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span> button inside <span style="font-weight: bold;">PBM</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span> may
also be assigned a hot-key, or may be accessed directly from the
TitanPA addon. The 32 listboxes each contain the blessings we normally
assign to other players. They are arranged in four columns. Solo,
for Casting Buffs when not inside a party/raid, or casting a buff on
someone outside your party or raid. Party for buffs you want to apply
to members of your own party. Raid for members of your raid. Note the
checkbox that indicates if you will ignore party buffs when in a raid.
If this box is unchecked, Panza will use separate buffs for your party
when raiding. Note that paladins using Greater Blessings will always
use the raid, or Battleground selections as these buffs are class
specific and applied to the whole raid. Battleground buffs will only be used if this option is
enabled, and you are inside a Battleground. The buffs may also be used
if you, or your target is flagged for <span style="font-weight: bold;">PvP</span>.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span> has saved blessing sets and 4 levels of blessings. Radio Buttons
allow you to switch among each level. Each saved blessing set will
containing all 4 levels, and can be named anything you want. Each level
will be used as a backup blessing for Paladins, and Multi-buff for other
classes. For instance Paladins may choose to backup might with wisdom
then light depending on class and location (party/raid/etc).
Priests may choose to define Fortitude, and Divine Spirit (for most
classes), then in level 3 specify all classes receive Shadow
Protection. Each saved set may include any combination of these.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span> also has a "Set all to.." listbox at the top of each column. Use
this listbox to quickly change all classes to one buff, then go back to
each class to customize it further.
DCB is color-coded to highlight what location you are using, and
color-codes the levels to indicate where a backup might be needed.</p>




<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId103533"></a><a name="Blessing_List"></a><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId910200"></a>Blessing List</h4>









<p> A blessing list may be maintained per individual player.
Anytime
you cast a buff on another player while pressing the control key, the
blessing you are casting is saved for this player
into the Blessing List. This blessing becomes that player's default
blessing that is used anytime the player is auto-blessed. There are
several commands used to maintain this list, and one command line only
function that must be used via the
"/script" command. The blessings in this list override any default
class
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">DCB</span>) blessing. Only the blessing name, and the player's name is saved
in the list. The first entry in this list is your character, "player".
The current version supports multiple characters on multiple realms.</p>




<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId19273"></a><a name="Debuffing"></a><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId669669"></a>Debuffing (PCM)</h3>


<p>
Debuffing is another core component of Panza. Using the Cure macro (/pa
asCure) Panza will select the most appropriate target (selection based
on class, health and number of debuffs) and cast the relevant debuffing
spell.
</p>


<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId640248"></a>Offense (POM)</h3>


<p>
Currently the offense features are geared towards Paladins. This will change as we upgrade Panza for other classes. However the <a href="#Custom_Offense_Messages">Custom Offense Messages</a> are applicable to all classes.</p>




<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId259187"></a>Seal Menu</h4>


<p>
This is a small (two buttons) menu that allows control of seals and
judgments. The left button shows the Primary Seal and this is cast and
judged as soon as possible. The right button shows the Secondary Seal
which is cast as soon as the Primary is judged but it is not judged
itself. To change the Primary Seal left-click on the pop-up menu. To
change the Secondary seal the right-click on the pop-up menu. Click the
Seal Menu to activate the next seal/judgment. The text above the
SealMenu attempts to predict the next spell that will cast. If the text
is green then the spell is ready, if white then the spell is on
cool-down (number shows seconds remaining).</p>



<p>
The Seal Menu may also optionally cast offensive spells such as
HolyShock (with or without Divine Favor), Exorcism and Hammer of Wrath.</p>


<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId615941"></a>Player vs Player (PvP)</h3>


<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId861679"></a>General</h4>


<ul>


  <li><a name="Auto_BoSaf"></a>Auto BoSaf - When your PvP flag is set the BoSaf macro (and the <a href="#Combination">asComb</a>
function) can optionally attempt to keep Blessing of Sacrifice up on a
nearby player
(Warrior&gt;Rogue&gt;Druid&gt;Paladin&gt;Shaman&gt;Hunter&gt;Warlock&gt;Priest&gt;Mage)</li>


  <li>CycleNear - When in a BattleGround and not yet in a raid use
CycleNear to bless people. The blessings will be remembered when you
join the raid.</li>


</ul>


<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId553875"></a>Warsong Gulch</h4>


<ul>


  <li>Flag Carriers - Panza will track who has the flag (both sides) and offers key binds for selecting them.</li>


  <li>Friendly Flag Carrier bias - When the player carrying the Enemy's
flag is in range Panza will attempt to bless him with Blessing of
Freedom and Healing and Curing will be heavily biased towards the flag
carrier.</li>


</ul>


<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId362174"></a>Special Functions</h2>


<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId464536"></a><a name="Combination"></a>Combination (asComb)</h4>


<p>The asComb function will currently attempt the following actions in
order, if any of the actions succeed then the rest are skipped:</p>


<ol>


  <li>Auto Blessing of Sacrifice [if configured + PVP flag on] see <a href="#Auto_BoSaf">here</a></li>


  <li><a href="#Debuffing">asCure</a></li>


  <li>Free</li>


  <li><a href="#Buffing">CycleBless</a></li>


</ol>


<p>Currently this is only available as a keybind or via /pa ascomb</p>


<p>It doesn't do healing although people have made their own macros to do this like this:<br />


<br />


/pa ascomb<br />


/pa asheal</p>


<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId569972"></a>Panic</h4>


<p>If a player is below their class health limit (PHM--&gt;Panic) then
activating the panic function (via the macro or keybind) will cause the
following actions to be followed:</p>


<ol>


  <li>Cast Lay on Hands if our mana is critically low (under 275)</li>


  <li>Cast shield (PowerWord:Shield or Blessing of Protection)</li>


  <li>Cast Holy Shock if shield not up</li>


  <li>Cast Lay on Hands if shield not up</li>


  <li>Debuff target</li>


  <li>Cast Healing Special (Divine Favor, Inner Focus, Nature's Swiftness, Omen of Clarity)</li>


  <li>Cast BestHeal (Force a flash heal if shield not up)</li>


</ol>


<p>Each successful action requires a key press so keep hitting the panic button for full effect.</p>


<p>If you can see disaster approaching then spamming the macro/key very fast will ramp-up a bias until the Panic fires.</p>


<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId289199"></a>Messaging</h3>




<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId149174"></a>Spell Notification (PAM)</h4>









<p>Panza uses a system called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAM</span> to control how messages are
displayed and sent to other players. You access <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAM</span> by using a key
binding, or
selecting the [<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAM</span>] button from the main options dialog. <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAM</span> allows you
to
specify a threshold for how many messages are shown.&nbsp; The
levels are "Error
Only", "Normal", "Low Detail", "Medium Detail", "High Detail", and
"Debug". Each
main main sub-system of <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA</span> has <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAM</span> level settings. These are
"Blessing",
"Healing", "Curing", "User-Interface", and "Core". The spell casting
sub-systems
(Bless, Heal, Cure) have additional checkboxes on who, and how you want
messages
about these systems sent to. Each of these settings have tooltips to
explain
their function.&nbsp; You may also disable all messaging by typing
"/pa quiet"
on the command line.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId888008"></a><a name="Custom_Offense_Messages"></a>Custom Offense Messages (PAM--&gt;Custom)</h4>


<p>
Each damage spell can have its own custom messages defined (one each
for normal and critical hits). This message can be automatically
delivered as an emote or say or tell (party/raid) whenever the spell
lands.





</p>


<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId571265"></a>Saved Settings</h3>









<p>All options, parameters, and switches are saved between game
sessions in
the Panza.lua saved variables file under your WTF directory.</p>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId398714"></a><a name="Commands"></a>Commands:</h3>









<p>The commands listed with Macro need to be driven by a button
press
for the Macro. If Target is specified, there needs to be something
targeted. Commands listed as Toggle will change between on and off each
time you use them. Settings are saved in the SavedVariables directory
in a file called Panza.lua. Even though some blessings and spells do
not
have ranks, level checks must still be made to conform to the spell
level - 10 rule. Not all the commands will be available depending on
which spells you have learnt. </p>

New Module (PCS)<br />

PCS - Paladin Class Selection.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows you to select Heal/Cure/Bless/Free/Panic by class.<br />

(RGS) Updated to support Free and Panic Selection. When upgrading to this version, RGS settings will be reset to default.<br />

(PHM) Party Bias control adds weight to heal party before others in raid. range is 0-100%. 0 will heal entire raid equally.<br />

(PHM) Self Bias control to weight yourself for healing. Range is -100% to +100% centered on 0.<br />

Failed list extended to include all PA spells<br />

TitanPA included within PA folder. Please un-install TitanPalast in the interface\addons directory.<br />

TitanPA is classified as a Combat Addon, so enable it there.<br />

Detailed instructions for TitanPA are included in the manual.<br />

CycleBless now will bless Classes with GreaterBlessings, There is a new
slider threhold on PBM the sets how many of a class need to be in range
before a Greater blessing is cast<br />

New Holy Shock stage added to panic<br />

<br />

Note: In this version "Actionbar range checking" will cause a slight delay when using Greater Blessings in Cycles. If speed<br />

is a concern, turn this option off in the Main Dialog. We will work on increasing the speed in future releases. If you disable<br />

the action bar range checking your count will be off and range will we
reduced by 12 yards (to 28) for healing, and 2 yards for blessings.<br />

IMO giving up a little speed is well worth the extra range, and better reporting. Send your thanks to Blizzard for making it so<br />

hard to range check.<br />

Low Threshold to Force Flash of Light. New Slider in PHM. Target Health at<br />

or below this threshold will receive flash of Light helaing spells.<br />

New Modules (PFM) and (PAW).<br />

PFM - Paladin Free Module controls the asfree macro.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PFM priority only will be used in this
release. The sliders for weighting have no effect at this time.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PFM weighting, if and when it is
implemented could be anything. The health sliders mean nothing atm.<br />

PAW - Paladin Whisper allows other players to set their saved blessing by sending tells to you with keywords of blessings.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAW will only setup saved blessings with blessings you have.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAW will send a list of blessings you
support if someone sends you a tell with the word paw in it.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAW is not a replacement for
Whispercast, as it has no queue, nor will it respond to cure/stuck
messages.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may toggle PAW with /pa paw.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAW can be silent if you wish by disabling responses. this can be toggled with /pa pawresp.<br />

Symbol of Kings count is maintained and checked before using Greater Blessings.<br />

Symbol of Divinity count is also maintained. These two items are
counted at the same time and are returned from the same function.<br />

BonusScanner is now the only Item Bonus support provided. You must use the latest version.<br />

<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId221316"></a>2.0&nbsp; Released in 10/11/05</h3>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Paladin Assistant Messages (PAM)</b>. PAM is
the core Message dispatcher for PA. PAM also filters messages and
announcements sent to other players, and decides all spell cast
success/failure. PAM has message level controls that will filter the
number of messages, and notification controls that specify whom to send
messages to. The notification modes are Party, Raid, Whisper, Say, and
Emote.&nbsp; Separate notification modes, and levels are
configurable for Healing, Blessing, and Curing. Additional Level
Controls are available for PA's User Interface, and internal core
functions. Dynamic tooltips describe each level in detail. The lowest
level is "Errors Only, which will only show errors, while the highest
level is "All Messages" which is a Debug Setting. </li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Automatic Macro Creation</b> using the Macro
button. Use this to automatically create
or update
all of the macros required to use PA functions!</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Auto-Select (AS)</b> functions for Blessing,
Healing, and Curing. The "AS" Functions automatically determine the
"mode" of the function. Mode being Solo, Party, Raid. The AS functions
replaced the previous "Auto" functions found in 1.3 and prior versions.
</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Default Class Blessings (DCB)</b>. DCB
replaces the defclassBuff[] array you once had to manually edit. DCB is
a Dialog that allows you to change any blessing for any class at any
time, and is accessible from the PBM module, or via a dedicated
hot-key. </li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Integration with <b>MapLibrary</b> for range
calculation. MapLibrary 1.4.4 is included in the distribution.</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Raid Group Selection (RGS)</b>. RGS will allow
the selection of specific groups in a Raid to receive Blessings,
Healing, and Curing. Members of other groups will not receive spells.
This feature will conserve power and enable raid leaders to distribute
the work among several players. </li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Blessing Expiring Warning System (BEWS)</b>.&nbsp;
BEWS, when enabled, will warn you when blessings are about to expire.
In this release the warnings start 60 seconds prior to your blessing
expiring, then for the next 30 seconds, at 10 second intervals you
receive additional warnings, and finally 30 seconds beyond the 30
second warning you receive a notice that the blessing has expired. This
may become more configurable in the future.&nbsp; Also note this
feature is only enabled on 5 minute blessings, and this feature does
not track blessings on other people, only the caster. When enabled
(default) BEWS will activate and reset every time you bless yourself.
This may help remind you when to start your next CycleBless. </li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">New Threshold in GUI called <b>Minimum Health Threshold</b>.&nbsp;
This threshold will be the threshold for healing. Any health ratio
below this setting will get healed, and any above it will be healed
only when no other entity needs healing more. Default is 98%.</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">The option to <b>Skip PvP flagged players</b>
when healing, blessing, or curing. This setting never has an effect on
player, or anyone on battlefields where PvP flagged is normal. </li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">The <b>Healing engine may be adjusted between
under-healing to over-healing by +-2 Ranks</b>. This adjustment
is made post automatic rank selection. This will help account for
bonuses and debuffs not automatically accounted for.</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">The Healing engine will <b>detect Amplify Magic</b>
and apply the bonus gained from this spell to healing spell rank
selection.</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;">The Healing engine will <b>detect Divine Favor</b>
and apply the minimum critical heal bonus to healing spell rank
selection.</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Integration with Titan Item Bonus Plug-in or
BonusScanner Library</b>.&nbsp; PA will detect if Item Bonus,
or BonusScan is installed, and will use the +Healing value obtained to
adjust healing spell rank selection. To obtain this +healing value, you
must install Titan Panel, and the Item Bonus Plugin, or install the
BonusScanner Library.&nbsp;</li>









<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Modular components</b> for PA's configurable
main sub-systems. These include the <b>PBM</b> (<b>Paladin
Blessing Module</b>), and <b>PHM</b> (<b>Paladin
Healing Module</b>). Going forward, these components will become
Plugin Addons.&nbsp; </li>









<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId33384"></a>Fixes included in 2.0</h4>









<ul>









  <li>PA will no longer load for classes other than Paladin.</li>









  <li>All spell casting is event driven for success/failure
detection. See PAM.</li>









  <li>Autoheal (now called ASHeal) will now heal solo, party,
party pets, raid, and raid pets. There
is no need for a separate macro to heal raid members or pets. The only
healing
function actually needed is "/pa asheal" for automatic healing. "/pa
bestheal"
for target healing may still be used, but is not a requirement.. All
other heal
commands will be phased out over time, and will no longer show in the
help but
will continue to work for some time. ASHeal will heal friendly targets
if
they are specifically targeted which used to require "/pa bestheal".
ASHeal
will always heal solo/party/raid first. The use of bestheal will
continue to
provide direct target based rank selection healing as always, and is
the core
healing engine for PA. Bestheal has been updated extensively in version
2.0. </li>









  <li>The GUI incompatibility problem with some other GUIs has
been solved. It was
an incorrect API call for the type of interface we have.</li>









  <li>MyAddon's Support updated to version 2.4, and all of
MyAddon's
options are programmed.</li>









  <li>Cyclebless, and CycleNear have been re-written completely
from scratch to become more consistent.</li>









  <li>Settings will be upgraded whenever possible beyond version
1.30.</li>









  <li>Announcements received a major overhaul, and provide more
information
with fewer messages. See PAM.</li>









  <li>Pets are auto cured in party and raid.</li>









  <li>Any PA command may now be prefixed with /pa instead of
/paladin.</li>









  <li>Various nil errors were identified and protection was
introduced to minimize
these errors.</li>









  <li>Updated for use with the WoW 1.8 Client.</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId227998"></a>1.3&nbsp; Released in 07/16/05</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId474171"></a>Fixes included in 1.3</h4>









<ul>









  <li>CycleBless will no longer break and reset the cycle when
CheckTarget()
fails.</li>









  <li>Autocure correctly cures Magic, and will also cure when
health is 100%</li>









  <li>Cyclenear list will no longer timeout after just 10 seconds.</li>









  <li>Blessing of Light Tooltip fix for WoW 1.6 Client upgrade.
(English and French Versions. German patch in 1.31 Asap!)</li>









  <li>Discontinued use of the Join() function in messages. This
will prevent error
dialog boxes from appearing when non-string data is being concatenated.
  </li>









  <li>Low level Paladins can now correctly cast from default
class setup. Wisdom
Rank 1 level changed to the correct level 14, and Might Rank 1 changed
to the
correct level 4.</li>









  <li>Upgraded several functions to use the new API features
available
in WoW's 1.6 Client</li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId300995"></a>Features introduced in 1.3</h4>









<ul>









  <li>CycleBless will now bless Party, Party Pets, Raid Members,
and Raid pets,
and the Caster of course, with just one button.&nbsp; You will have
to press it
a few...dozen times or so, but its still just one button. </li>









  <li>Automatic Pet Healing in AutoHeal() if all party health is
above the new
configurable "Pet Healing"&nbsp; threshold.&nbsp; </li>









  <li>Spell Cool-down checks are made before any Blessing,
Healing, or Curing spell
is cast.</li>









  <li>Heal Spell Switching, or (HSS) monitors a small threshold
of cool-downs from the
two healing spells. If the cool-down period is greater, it switches from
Holy
Light to Flash of Light, or visa versa, then back again once the spell
is
available.</li>









  <li>Implemented spell cool-down checking on all PA spell casts</li>









  <li>Key Bindings with the ability to toggle the use of the ALT
and CTRL keys.
These functions enable or disable the Blessing Save, and Self Blessing
features.
Bindings are also included for all of the blessing list options, and
one to
display the GUI.</li>









  <li>New display option toggle for Healing Spell progress
reporting. This option
will report estimated arrival time, delays as they occur. These
messages will be
sent to the players the spells are being cast on, or the local chat
window. </li>









  <li>Extensive French and German Translation work by AmorGrid
and Seriosha.</li>









  <li>Blessing of Freedom, and Blessing of Protection may be
macro cast
(/paladin bo(whatever)), bringing the blessing count to 9.</li>









  <li>Assistant will use the Notify() function for all Healing
failures.
Messages will be set to party, or raid. Notify() has always sent
messages to the
local chat window, if no other options were enabled.</li>









  <li>Updated the GUI with tooltips (localized)</li>









  <li>Support for MyAddOns added.</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId507245"></a>1.2&nbsp; Released on 07/08/05</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId692257"></a>Fixes included in 1.2</h4>









<ul>









  <li>A GUI that can be accessed from the MiniMap or command line.</li>









  <li>Corrected a mistake in the / processor for cleartarget</li>









  <li>The field names in defclassbuff have changed to solo,
party, and raid to
make their function more clearly defined. Their function is documented
in the
manual.</li>









  <li>Modified the help screen to show required "/script "
commands</li>









  <li>Cleanse will only be used if you need to cure Magic,
otherwise Purify will be used.</li>









  <li>Initial Spell check for Flash of Light selection in
BestHeal()</li>









  <li>Corrected some error reporting code in BuffBylevel() </li>









  <li>Blessing of Sacrifice was added to the / processor and the
tables for it completed.</li>









  <li>Blessing of Sanctuary was added to the / processor and
tables for it completed. </li>









  <li>Corrected a cure issue that would cause nil exception when
not a curable debuff.</li>









  <li>AutoBless will now select the party buff over the raid
buff. The new order is saved, party, raid.
then solo.&nbsp;The
party blessing will be used if the target is in your party, even when
in a raid
group. The raid blessing will only be used on raid group members that
are not
members of your own party.</li>









  <li>Corrected the code in group debuff function that was not
using correct
index. </li>









  <li>The forcenotify function will now send its messages over
the Raid channel
instead of the Party channel if you are in a Raid group.</li>









  <li>Corrected two French Translation Errors. </li>









  <li>Corrected a severe Initialization error. In all previous
versions, the Paladin_Initialize() function was first called on the
VARIABLES_LOADED event. When WoW first loads, this event does not
provide any spell book, or character data. This prevented the Addon from
correctly reading the spell book. </li>









  <li>Removed all instances of UnitInRaid() because that function
is currently broken.</li>









  <li>Changed the default raid buff from bosal to bow. Salvation
does
not seem to want to work on raid group members. These last two items
are supposed to be covered in the 1.6 client release, so I will revisit
this then. </li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId241291"></a>Features introduced in 1.2 </h4>









<ul>









  <li>Blessings can be saved per player by using control+macro
button when using a /paladin <buff> </buff>
command. That saved blessing will be used hereafter when that player is
AutoBlessed. "/paladin show" will now report how many entries are on
this list. There are also a few new commands used to manage this list.







    
    
    <pre> /paladin listparty List blessings for the players in your current party.<br /> /paladin listraid List blessings for the players in your current raid group.<br /> /paladin listall List every player that has a saved blessing.<br /> /paladin cleartarget Clear the blessing for the player currently targeted.<br /> /paladin clearall Clear the entire list, and re-create it with "players" blessing.</pre>
















    
    
    
    <p>Command line function Paladin_Clearname("name") is used to
clear
a single name. from the BuffList. Syntax is: /script
Paladin_ClearName("name") where name is the entry you want to clear.
There will always be a "player" record, and you may not delete this one.</p>
















    
    
    
    <p>In the next few releases, several more command will be
included
for the Blessing list including ways to automatically update the list
as members leave the party/raid and commands to remove all blessings
belonging to party/raid members. This function will be updated to
become multi-player aware so this Addon's feature may be shared between
Paladins on the same account. Each Paladin having a unique list.</p>
















    
    
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>









  </li>









  <li>Blessing of Light is detected on healing targets. The
tooltip
is read and the amount of extra healing is used in calculating the
healing spell rank selection. There is a new command line option
"/paladin bolverb" that will show this extra healing information for
each spell as it is cast. The default setting for this extra display is
off, but the extra healing information will always be used if it is
detected. Note this will only work on EN clients. The tooltip text
needs to be translated.</li>









  <li>Mana costs updated for healing spells during
Initialization, or when spells/points change. This information is also
used in spell rank selection.</li>









  <li>The cure code uses inverse of health to scale status by who
is affected by the most debuffs, and has lowest health. This inverse is
the inverse of the health ratio. i.e. if your health is 70% you get 30
for your inverse. If your health is 20%, you have 80. Higher numbers
take priority. The next evolution of this code will use class in the
priority as well.</li>









  <li>created a Paladin_Reset function that may be used via
/script to reset the Paladin variable to stock settings. use "/script
Paladin_Reset()" to reset Paladin Assistant.</li>









  <li>A new how-to manual is included in the readme</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId927695"></a>1.11 Released on 07/05/05</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId66589"></a>Fixes included in 1.11</h4>









<ul>









  <li>Initialization code now calculates correct min and max
values from spell book.</li>









  <li>Improved error reporting in Blessing code.</li>









  <li>When the player level is below the level required for the
default
class blessing: "Blessing of Salvation", the blessings are reconfigured
to use "Blessing of Wisdom" for "Inside Group", and "Raid Group".</li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId539593"></a>Features included in 1.11</h4>









<ul>









  <li>Cure Code finished and implemented. "/paladin autocure" and
"/paladin bestcure" will use purify or cleanse.</li>









  <li>New setting: Paladin.Settings.Heal.FolTH sets Mana
threshold to exclusive use of Flash of Light spells.</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId287995"></a>1.1 Released 07/02/05</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId858390"></a>Fixes included in 1.1</h4>









<ul>









  <li>The CheckTraget(unit) function's range checking code had a
slight
issue. It would return true from the entire CheckTarget() function if:







    
    
    <ol>









      <li>CheckInteractDistance returned false and</li>









      <li>The Range returned by GetRangeToUnit() was &gt;0
and &lt;= 30.</li>
















    
    
    
    </ol>









This would bypass all other checks in CheckTarget() I'm not aware of
any specific issues because of this, but it's been corrected anyway.</li>









  <li>Blessing of Salvation and other spells without ranks could
not be cast.</li>









  <li>A small flaw in some conditional (for n=1, total do) loops
was
corrected that would sometimes cause every other "n" to skip. This was
probably present from v1.0 of the Helper App.</li>









  <li>Added a UnitExists() check to the beginning of
CheckTarget() to avoid rare runtime errors. </li>









  <li>Fixed the Initialize function where updated healing amounts
from spells were not being saved.</li>









  <li>The GetRank() function was not returning valid values, and
was updated. It is only used for display purposes at this time.</li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId144967"></a>Features included in 1.1</h4>









<ul>









  <li>"/paladin autocure" and "/paladin bestcure" were added.
Autocure
will cure party or raid group. Note in this release, the functions only
find who is infected. I ran out of time fixing some nasty issues this
week. 1.11 will be a patch to finish the cure functions. </li>









  <li>autobless has three buffs to pick from depending on if you
are
grouped or not. the defclassbuff array has a "ig" (inside group) buff,
"og" for outside group buff, and "rg" for raid group buff. The logic in
the autobless function has been simplified to use this variable now.
The default group settings are everyone gets Salvation but Warriors. I
used my healadin setting of paladins in your group get Wisdom, but
outside it get Might. You can change the buffs for any class in
defclassbuff.</li>









  <li>New setting "/paladin inform" that will inform the player
via
whisper that they will receive the heal/buff. In verbose mode this will
be set to false by default (while you are in a group). In quiet mode it
will be set to true by default. You can also change it manually with
"/paladin inform". I saw another Addon doing something like this and I
was instantly hooked. </li>









  <li>Better estimation of HP for targets outside the group using
class scales.</li>









  <li>Blessing of Kings was added to the command list.</li>









  <li>Localization for German and French Clients</li>









</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId269031"></a>1.01 Released on 6/30/05</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId689129"></a>Fixes included in 1.01</h4>









<ul>









  <li>The friendly target bug is gone. Notice if you have one
targeted,
and try to heal lowest in party, or buff/heal yourself, your target
will be cleared. No clearing will take place if you have the enemy
targeted, and/or are in battle. This is much better than casting a heal
on something that may not need any healing at all.</li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId248966"></a>Features introduced in 1.01</h4>

</ul>









<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId917526"></a>1.0 Never released to public</h3>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId805084"></a>Fixes included in 1.0:</h4>









<ul>









  <li>Initialization sets correct min and max for HL and FL
spells. HL
spells use floating point, which caused min and max values for HL
spells to only include the decimal. The effect varied but some spells
would have higher mins, than maxes, or 0 for both min and max. This
affected the logic in
BestHeal. Note this effect would only show up if you used training
points to
improve holy spells.</li>









  <li>Autobuff, and all level based buffing sets correct level
buff for all level players. (Buff Level - 10)</li>









  <li>BestHeal was calling Paladin_CombineSpell. That function
was renamed CombinSpell. </li>









  <li>"/paladin bow" now works as intended.</li>









  <li>the Paladin class itself will receive "Blessing of Might"
blessing by default.</li>









</ul>









<h4><a class="mozTocH5" name="mozTocId810005"></a>Features Introduced in 1.0:</h4>









<ul>









  <li>Mana checks in the Healing code. 1st check is to verify
enough is
available for rank 1 spells. 2nd check is after spell selection. Rank
will be reduced until enough is available.</li>









  <li>BestHeal uses "Flash of Light" Spells when target health is
at or
above 70%. Note that no previous versions used Flash of Light spells
automatically.</li>









  <li>Estimated HP of Friendly Targets in BestHeal (Heal outside
of group with
BestHeal)</li>









  <li>New "/paladin raidheal" will heal raid member with lowest
health.
If not in a raid, this command will function just like the autoheal in
"party/solo" mode.</li>









  <li>Divine Intervention "/paladin di" will cast divine
intervention
on closest alive paladin, priest, or druid in that order. A message
will be sent to the group, or raid, letting everyone know what you are
doing. Verbose mode has no effect on this message.</li>









  <li>Added Level Based Blessing of Light. This "will" also be
used in Bestheal (when
I am 40 and can test it), it will be detected on each target. </li>









  <li>Range is calculated between player and target. Range is set
and
used on all spells. Notice if you are in a instance, the ranges will
always be -1. Make sure you are within 20-30 yards.</li>









  <li>New Paladin variable for settings which will be used in the
upcoming v2.0 w/Gui release.</li>









  <li>More safety checks for buffs and heals.</li>









  <li>Command line help added.</li>









</ul>









<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId878366"></a>Notes:</h2>









<p>You can go right ahead and modify this to suit your needs.
Like any specific pieces? Copy them.</p>









<p> The original code base was Avalon's 1.1 and 1.6 Paladin
Helper. 1.6
was
Avalon's last release. The Paladin Helper was renamed to Paladin
Assistant and
the version was moved back to 1.0. The 1.0 release was Paladin Helper
1.6 with a
few of my patches and additions (see the history).&nbsp; Since that
time,
Paladin Assistant, now Panza, often referred to simply as PA, has
increased in size over 800% from the features and logic added. It no
longer
looks anything like the original Helper; Every original function has
been
completely rewritten, overhauled, or dramatically changed many times
over,
but Avalon's original concept lives on, and functionality is constantly
moving
forward. Avalon has asked me several times to remove this statement,
but I still hope Avalon will return to WoW one day, and join the PA
team!</p>

<p>I don't want to get credit for something you did (good or
bad). =) Also be
