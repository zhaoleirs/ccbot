<h4>Show the Options Window</h4>

also left-click the icon on the minimap and drag it to your desired

<h4>Notes</h4>




<ul>



  <li>The blessing/buff macros are designed to directly replace the ones from your spell-book. Simply replace them on your Action Bar.</li>



  <li>The HEAL macro is designed to directly replace your Holy
Light/Heal/Lessor/Greater etc and Flash spells. We recommend you use
them in parallel until you are happy with how Panza works.</li>



  <li>The BEST macro is target based healing, whereas the HEAL macro selects your target.</li>



  <li>The CURE macro is designed to directly replace your
Cleanse,Purify,Dispel Magic, Cure disease, Abolish disease spells.
Simply replace them on your Action Bar.</li>



  <li>The DI macro (Paladin only) is designed to directly replace your
Divine Intervention spell. Simply replace it on your Action Bar.</li>



  <li>The PWS macro (Priest only) is designed to directly replace your PowerWord:Shield spell. Simply replace it on your Action Bar.</li>



  <li>The HEAL, BEST, BLESS, CURE, CYCLE, and NEAR macros could become your main workhorse buttons.</li>



  <li>The REZ macro is designed to replace your resurrection spell. Simply replace it on your Action Bar.</li>



</ul>




<p>Buff/Blessing macros are placed in the per character macros page.
The main interchangeable HEAL, BEST, CURE, REZ macros are placed in the
global slots. All
Macro text is updated automatically as you gain spell ranks. When you
learn a new spell that you had previously not known, run the Macros
command again; From
then on, Panza will then update the text displayed automatically. The
text displayed for the tooltip of most macros is from the highest rank
of the spell in your spellbook.</p>




<h4>Using Panza</h4>




<ul>




  <li>To bless/buff a target hit the BLESS macro. Panza will choose a buff/blessing appropriate to the target's class and level.</li>



  <li>To give a target a certain blessing use the relevant blessing macro. Panza will choose a rank appropriate to the target's level.</li>



  <li>To heal hit the HEAL button. If you are in a party/raid Panza will choose the most appropriate member for the heal.</li>



  <li>To heal a specific player, target the player and use the Best
Macro. Panza will choose a spell, and rank based on lost HP of the
target.</li>



  <li>To cure hit the CURE button. If you are in a party/raid Panza will choose the most appropriate member to be cured.</li>




</ul>





<h4>Blessing Multiple Players</h4>




<p>Due to restrictions imposed by Blizzard to prevent botting
AddOns/Macros are limited to only one spell for each button press. This
makes it
<i><b>impossible</b></i> to hit a button and have everyone in the
party blessed from that single keystroke. Therefore in order to bless
multiple players it is required to hit a button once for each player to
be blessed.
Fortunately with Panza the hard part is done automatically and all you
need do is hit a single button multiple times:</p>




<ul>




  <li>To bless your entire party/raid hit the CYCLE button. Keep
hitting the button, once for each member (you must wait for the
blessing cool-down between each button press, currently 1.5s). Panza
will inform you when everyone is blessed</li>



  <li>To bless nearby friendlies hit the NEAR button. Keep hitting the
button, once for each friendly (you must wait for the blessing
cool-down between each button press, currently 1.5s). Panza will inform
you when everyone nearby is blessed</li>




</ul>
