		<description>PartySpotter v3.00.11200 - MAJOR RELEASE
-----------------------------------------

Small, standalone Modification that highlights which people on the WorldMap are in your Party, and which are in your Raid Group.

ALSO Allows you to target players by clicking on their Map Icons (or an individually Highlighted Player you can track via the Minimap)

Compatible with the WorldMap, AlphaMap(optional), BattlefieldMinimap, MetaMap(optional).

By default, players in different raid groups are displayed on maps with numbered Icons indicating their raid group, but 2 alternative modes are available :

1.) Each raid group can be displayed in a different colour.  Players can change the colours by Right-Clicking on that Group's button on the Map Key (Map Legend).  Group Headings in the Raid Frame, and Raid Pullout Frames are also coloured to match the on map dots.  There is also an option to change the colour of BattleGround and Raid messages from Raid members to match the PartySpotter colour for that Group. (/pspot -c)

2.) OR Simply have your local Party showing as one colour (default Blue), and all other Raid/Battleground members as another colour. Nice and simple to track your Party if you don't NEED to track all parties separately.

NOTE : To take full advantage of this AddOn's features, don't forget to use the provided Key bindings to cycle through the main modes :)

When in a Raid, then chat from other Raid members will be prefixed by their Group number.

You can Highlight particular Raid Groups on the map to make them easier to find/track by left-clicking on a group number on the Map Key. While highlighted, player tooltips on the map will only list players in the highlighted group, and player targetting by clicking on the Map dots will only work for members of the highlighted group.

EXTRA Features include the ability to highlight friends, ignores, guild members, the raid leader, or any individual player you specify, as long as they are in the same party/raid, or in the same BattleGround.
Added a &quot;Highlight&quot; option to the Right-click menus for Player/Party/Raid Popups. So, for example, you can now Right-Click on a Player's Portrait, or their name in the Raid window, and choose the &quot;Highlight&quot; option, and they will appear on the Map with a Red &quot;X&quot; so that you can locate/track them.
Highlighted Individuals are can also be tracked via a Red &quot;X&quot; icon on the Minimap.

USE   &quot;/pspot&quot;   FOR A STATUS REPORT AND A FULL LIST OF SLASH COMMANDS.

Please Note :
a.) You can't make the PartySpotter key visible unless you are in a Party/Raid/Battleground, so Toggling the PartySpotter Map Legend with the key-binding won't appear to do much at all if you are sitting on your own in Orgrimmar ;p
b.) Coloured Raid Headings and Chat are only available when you are viewing each Raid sub-group with differently coloured icons, and not when using the default Numbered Icons, or just showing other raid sub-groups in a single colour.

Developed mainly because in BattleGrounds, EVERYONE is represented with the same default Yellow Icon, and you can't tell who you are grouped with easily.

Localisation : German, French.
(Couple of Version 3 options not yet localised)



----------------------------------------
Full Feature List for Version 3.00.11200
----------------------------------------

Version 3 should work with ALL clients.

Note: where ever I say &quot;Map Key&quot;, you can substitute &quot;Map Legend&quot; if you are more familiar with that terminology ;)

- Default shows each sub-group in a Raid as a numbered icon, showing exactly which sub-group it belongs to   (/pspot showgroups numbers)

- OR can now show each sub-group in a Raid as a different colour  (/pspot showgroups icons)  { See the &quot;What Colour Group am I in?&quot; section of the PartySpotter Readme.txt file }  You can change the colours of any groups by RIGHT-CLICKING on the Map Key for that group and changing via the standard WoW Colour Picker frame.

- OR turn off sub-group highlights and use simple version 1 functionality to highlight your Party in one colour, and all other Raid members in another colour (/pspot showgroups off)

- PartySpotter Icons now show on BattleField MiniMap

- PartySpotter Icons now show on AlphaMap         : For full compatibility, AlphaMap must be updated to &quot;AlphaMap (Fan's Update)&quot;
PartySpotter does have limited support for original Alphamap (but must be in a Party/Raid before you will see any unit icons within BattleGrounds.)


- A PartySpotter Map Key visible on the WorldMap or AlphaMap/BattlefieldMinimap when in a Party/Raid, showing which icons/colours represent which Raid Groups.

- Left Click on a particular Raid Group on the PartySpotter Map Key to highlight that Group on the WorldMap/AlphaMap/BattlefieldMinimap and make sure it becomes visible if it was previously obscured by other player icons. All other PartySpotter icons will be hidden and revert back to the small default yellow dots, while the highlighted group will be displayed with a Numbered Icon. Click on the same group again to stop highlighting a particular group.
While highlighted, player tooltips on the map will only list players in the highlighted group, and player targetting by clicking on the Map dots will only work for members of the highlighted group.

- Right Click on a particular Raid Group in the Key to change the Colour that will represent that group on the Map

- The PartySpotter Map Key is draggable, and will remember where you last positioned it. (The WorldMap and AlphaMap/BattlefieldMinimap map keys are independant of each other. Note that there is one key for use with both the AlphaMap &amp; Battlefield minimap. Once moved, then it becomes independant from these frames, but it will only show when you have one or the other open.)

- You can use a Key Binding to toggle Show/Hide of the Map Keys for when you don't need to see them

- Messages from Raid/Battleground members will now be Prefixed with the number of the Raid Group they belong to e.g. &quot;[4] &quot;

- When viewing Coloured Map Icons, the Group Labels in the Raid Frame, and the headings of Raid Pullout frames will also be changed the same colour as the that group's on map icons.

- When viewing Coloured Map Icons, there is an additional option to change the colour of BattleGround/Raid messages to the colour you have specified for that Group's on map icons. Coloured Battleground/Raid messages are marked with an &quot;*&quot;, so the example message prefix above would become &quot;[4]*&quot; and the message would be the same colour as that group's icons. (Whispers, Yells, Says, etc.  will not have their colours changed but will still be prefixed by a Group number)

- Highlights of Friends/Ignores/Guild should take priority over other icons, so if you can't find a particular unit/group, make sure you disable Friend/Ignore/Guild highlighting

- Can now highlight the Raid Leader when you are in a Raid   &quot;/pspot -L&quot; toggles this function

- Can now highlight an individual player, so that you no longer have to mouse over lots of units to find a single unit    &quot;/pspot -t &lt;name&gt;&quot;

- Highlighted Individuals can be tracked by a Red &quot;X&quot; icon on the Minimap.

- In addition to a slash command, players can now highlight individual players via an additional &quot;Highlight&quot; option in the Right Click menus for Players/Party/Raid members
(Highlight the same player again to stop highlighting them)
For example this means you can target a player, and Right-Click his Portrait, and select &quot;Highligh&quot;, to show his on map Icon as a Red Cross display a tracking Icon on the Minimap.

Should be compatible with ALL Clients.
Please e-mail me if you find this AddOn is or is not compatible with a certain client.

Welcome any and all help with localisation of the few English words used :)

( This AddOn only needs to be installed on your machine to work and display other party members/raid members correctly.  i.e. it does NOT need to be installed on other member's machines for you to see them with a different coloured icon. Obviously, they can install it as well, and they will then see you displayed with a different colour ;)
