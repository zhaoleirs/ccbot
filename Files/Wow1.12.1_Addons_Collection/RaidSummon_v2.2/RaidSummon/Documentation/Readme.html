<h2>RaidSummon 2.2</h2>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>
RaidSummon will queue group/raidmembers that request to be summoned (by
whispering you a specific keyword) and notify you with an audio signal,
a text message and a flashing "Ritual of Summoning" action.<br />
Casting "Ritual of Summoning" will then summon the first player in the queue
and - if the ritual succeeded (RaidSummon detects failures) - remove him from
the list. Casting again will summon the next player and so on.<br />
Additionally, using the "Ritual of Summoning" action while targetting a
raid/group-member will perform a normal ritual of summoning on him - preferring
the target over already queued raid/group-members.<br />
It is also possible to automatically summon all raidmembers that are not
currently in your zone by using the button when nobody is queued or targetted.
</p>


<h3>TitanPanel users: Setting up Titan [RaidSummon]</h3>

<p>If you are using TitanPanel you might also want to download RaidSummon's
Titan plugin. Make sure it is enabled in WoW's addon options, then right-click
on a free area on the Panel and select RaidSummon from the "Interface" section
of the menu. The plugin features should be self explanatory.</p>


<h3>RaidSummon: How to use it</h3>

<ul>
<li> Target a group or raid member and use "Ritual of Summoning" as usual to
  summon your target. If the summoning failed (i.e. someone moved while
  assisting in the ritual), the player will remain queued and you will be
  alerted by an audio signal.</li>

<li> Have somebody of your raid/group whisper you with "summon" to queue the 
  player for summoning. You will be notified* about the request and can now
  summon this player by using the "Ritual of Summoning" action with no
  player targetted.</li>

<li>Cast "Ritual of Summoning" when nobody is targetted and the summon queue
  is empty to summon all members of the raid that are not currently in your
  zone.</li>

<li>Right-click the "Ritual of Summoning" action to display a menu with a few
  of the more important RaidSummon options.</li></ul>


<font size=2>* Notification by audio signal and textmessage. Your "Ritual of
  Summoning" actionbutton will also flash red and list all queued players in
  its tooltip. If you are using TitanPanel, TitanRaidSummon will indicate the
  name of the first player in queue and, if enabled, flash red/yellow.</font>

<h2>Commandline features</h2>

<p>Most of these features/options are also available from the actionbutton-menu,
but if you need to check your summoning statistics or define new request-keywords,
this is the place to look for it.</p>

<h3>Installation/Setup-Options:</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>/rsm lang &lt;de|en|fr&gt; </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Select message-language. This language will be used when RaidSummon needs
  to /tell a player or send a message to the raid (if enabled).
  By default, when using English, RaidSummon will listen for players whispering
  you the word "summon", "port" for German and "invocation" for French.
  Short requests will be prevented from getting displayed in the chatframe,
  requests that are longer than a few words will not be processed
  automatically, as they might contain other important information for the
  warlock. (I.e. "please summon me for hot elven action" will be displayed.)<br />
  <i>Default</i>: When using the addon for the first time, this will be set to your
  clients locale.<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm minimum &lt;i&gt; </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Sets the minimum number of shards. If the warlock has less shards than
  specified, summoning requests will be declined (of course you can still
  target players and summon them as usual).<br />
  <i>Default</i>: 7<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm resetkeywords</b><br />
  Wipes the list of known keywords. These keywords will be used to determine
  wheter a whisper is a summoning request or not. No summoning requests can be
  processed until at least one keyword has been added to the list.<br />
  <i>Default</i>: if the addon loads and no keyword is defined (ie. first load or
  list wipe and no keyword defined before exit), valid keywords will be
  "summon", "port" and "invocation".<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm addkeyword &lt;keyword&gt;</b><br />
  Adds a keyword to the list of keywords that trigger a summoning request
  (keywords may contain spaces)<br />
  <i>Default</i>: "summon", "port", "invocation"<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm toggleannounce or /rsm ta </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Enable or disable summoning messages. If enabled, a message will be sent to
  your raid/group when you are about to summon somebody, when the actual
  ritual of summoning begins (requesting players to assist) and when(if) the
  ritual fails.<br />
  <i>Default</i>: enabled<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm togglewhisper or /rsm tw </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Enable or disable whispers to players. These whispers are not visible from
  your local chatframe and only serve to inform the player that his summoning
  request was received and you are about to summon/out of shards and won't
  summon/afk etc.<br />
  <i>Default</i>: enabled<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm togglelisten or /rsm tl </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Enable or disable request processing. If disabled, raid/group-members will
  no longer be able to request summons with a simple whisper, but of course
  you will still be able to target and summon them as usual.<br />
  <i>Default</i>: enabled<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm toggleenable or /rsm te</b><br />
  Enable or disable RaidSummon. If disabled, RaidSummon will no longer
  monitor your "Ritual of Summoning" casts for success, record any stats,
  listen for summon requests, queue players or offer the improved
  "Ritual of Summoning" action. Addons like TitanRaidSummon will
  still be able to use all RaidSummon features, but won't be notified if a
  player requests to be summoned.<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm toggleflash or /rsm tf</b><br />
  Enable or disable action-button flashing. If enabled, the &quot;Ritual of Summoning&quot;
  action will flash while players are in the queue.<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm togglehidereplies or /rsm thp </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Show or hide RaidSummons' replies to players requesting summons in the
  ChatFrame. Note: To enable/disable these message use /rsm tw. This option
  merely hides the messages from your own chatframe.<br />
  <i>Default</i>: enabled<br /></li>

<li><b>/rsm togglehiderequests or /rsm thq </b><i>(also available from actionbutton-menu)</i><br />
  Show or hide accepted summoning request messages from other players. If
  enabled, accepted summoning requests will not be displayed in the chatframe.
  Note: Only requests that were automatically accepted will be hidden. In order
  for RaidSummon to automatically accept a request, it has to be very brief and
  contain at least one of the specified keywords (see /rsm addkeyword).<br />
  <i>Default</i>: disabled<br /></li>
 
<li><b>/rsm status</b><br />
  Displays current RaidSummon settings.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Support commands:</h3>
