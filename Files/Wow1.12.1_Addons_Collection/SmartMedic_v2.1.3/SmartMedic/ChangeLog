SmartMedic (formerly SmartBandage)	

Patch Notes

2.1.3

- Fix for fix for food and water support.  The tooltip stuff is pretty
tough to get right.  A big thanks to the thorough explanation at
http://www.wowwiki.com/UIOBJECT_GameTooltip.


2.1.2

- Fixed food and water support. 1.10 changed the way you must use Tooltips.

	
2.1.1

- Marked as compatible with the WoW 1.10 patch. No other changes.	
	

2.1

- Feature reporting how many of the item you're using are left has
  been corrected. Thanks oroghai.


2.1 beta 4

- This will hopefully be the last beta. I think SM is pretty stable at
  this point.

- Conjured items, if they meet or exceed the need, are now used before
  anything else. Thanks oroghai and amida.

- Now checks to see if you're in combat before attempting to eat or
  drink. This prevents SM from printing a message to chat and possibly
  fooling you into thinking it worked, when it didn't. Thanks rakxzo.

- Support for Alterac Valley battleground health and mana potions
  added. Thanks mindonfire.

- Now prevents double eating or drinking. If you're already eating or
  drinking, it won't eat or drink again. Prevents double taps from
  burning food/water. Thanks rakxzo.

- Now prints a more descriptive error when all potions, food, or water
  are in cooldown, instead of just saying none found.

- Now reports how many of the item you're using are left. Thanks
  rakxzo.


2.1 beta 3

Now recognizes more buff foods with a different variant of tooltip text (known now to include Grilled Squid). Please continue to report any buff foods that aren't detected! Thanks mindonfire.


2.1 beta 2

Fixes a problem with the SavedVariable config. Thanks crasher and amida.

2.0.1b

- Now recognizes Battleground food and water, and will only attempt to
  use them if in the appropriate battleground.

- Now allows bandaging friendly non-partymates.  Since you can only
  tell percentages, not actual HP of non-partymates, it will just use
  the best bandage in this case.  By default this is enabled, toggle
  it with /smartmedic bandageNonPartymates.

- Now allows eating food that gives you special buffs, as a last
  resort only if no other food is found.  SM will eat better
  (preferably) or worse regular food before dipping into your buff
  food supply.  I feel buff food should be managed manually, so by
  default this is disabled, however toggle it with /smartmedic
  eatBuffFood.

- Now allows adjusting the goal health/mana percentage when
  regenerating.  The default is 80%, i.e., SM will attempt to restore
  80% of the health or mana when bandaging/potioning/eating/drinking
  if the player or target is regenerating.  I find this is a good
  number, and conserves your resources.  You may adjust this either
  1. globally with /smartmedic goalHealthPctIfRegening ##, or 2. on
  individual SM calls like /smartmedic bandage ##.

- Now ignores items in cooldown, and will tell you, for example, "No
  (available) bandages found!" instead of attempting to use them and
  failing.  This also prevents SM from printing a message to chat and
  possibly fooling you into thinking it worked, when it didn't.

- Now checks for Recently Bandage on you or your target (of course,
  that only works if target is a partymate), and won't attempt to
  bandage in this case.  Again, prevents SM from printing a message to
  chat and possibly fooling you into thinking it worked, when it
  didn't.



2.0.1

- Now ignores items with cooldown.  Prevents error message.
- Now checks for Recently Bandaged debuff.  Prevents error message.
- Now checked items for Battleground message in their tooltip, and uses them appropriately.
- Now allows bandaging non-party members.  Will just use best bandage if target's health
  isn't 100%.

2.0

- Renamed "SmartMedic" since it now handles health/mana potions, food
  and water in addition to bandages.
- New health and mana potion support.  Will find and use the "right"
  potion for the job, just like it does for bandages.
- Food and water support.  Will find and use the "right" food or water
  item for the job, just like it does for bandages.
- The code that searches your inventory for items is now
  locale-independent.  I'm using Blizzard's itemIds instead of English
  names, so now SmartMedic should work for WoW clients in all
  regions.  Thanks to Jooky for this excellent suggestion.  Not quite
  full internationalization, since all the messages printed to the
  chat window are in English, but it's getting there :-).
- Now supports the Undead racial ability "Cannibalize", which will be
  used instead of a bandage if available.  Thanks barryj for the
  suggestion.
- If poisoned, prints out warning instead of wasting a bandage.
  Thanks peonpower for the suggestion.
- Now driven by and configured by a slash command (/sm).
