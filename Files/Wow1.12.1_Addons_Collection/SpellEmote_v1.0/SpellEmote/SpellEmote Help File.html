      <h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction<br>
      </h2>
&nbsp;SpellEmote is an addon that allows you to set emotes that will be
performed when you sucessfully damage an enemy with a spell or ability,
heal a target, or gain a buff. The emotes can be two types, say or
emote. A say emote will transmit the specified text exactly as if you
typed /say. An emote style will transmit the text as if you typed /me.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;The spell specified will fall into one of three types, damage
heal or buff. A damage spell is a spell or ability that causes damage
to a target. Only spells that show up in the form of "Your
&lt;spell&gt; hits &lt;target&gt; for &lt;damage&gt;" in the combat log
can be used. Heal spells show up in the combat log as "Your
&lt;spell&gt; heals &lt;target&gt; for &lt;amount&gt;". A buff spell
type shows up in the combat log as "You gain &lt;spell&gt;".<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;Keep in mind, you must spell the spell or ability name exactly as
it is shown in the combat log. Capitalization must also be correct,
"sinister strike" is not the same thing as "Sinister Strike".<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="add"></a>Adding an Emote</h2>
&nbsp;To add a new emote to SpellEmote, you use the slash command
/spellemote add.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;/spellemote add spell='Spell Name' text='Text to be said/emoted'
chance='0-100' emotetype='say/emote' spelltype='damage/heal/buff'
(optional)crit='yes'<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;Note that all parameters use single quotes or apostraphes
surrounding the parameter. For example, spell='Sinister Strike' is
correct, spell="Sinister Strike" is not.<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>spell='Spell Name' - Required - This is the name of the
spell or ability to respond to. As said above, this must be spelled and
capitalized exactly as it appears in the combat log when used. <br>
        </li>
        <li>text='Text to be said/emoted' - Required - This is the text
that will be spoken with /say or emoted with /me. For example, you
could use text='Take that!' as a say emote, or text='strikes the enemy'
as an emote type.</li>
        <li>chance='0-100' - Required - This is a number from 0 to 100,
a percentage, that represents the chance of the emote being performed
when your spell or ability hits the target. 0 means the emote will
never trigger, and 100 will trigger every single time.</li>
        <li>emotetype='say/emote' - Required - This is one of two
options, either "say" or "emote". Say will transmit the text in /say,
and emote will transmit the text using a /me emote.</li>
        <li>spelltype='damage/heal/buff' - Required - This will be one
of three choices, either "damage", "heal", or "buff". A damage spell is
a spell or ability that causes damage to a target.
Only spells that show up in the form of "Your &lt;spell&gt; hits
&lt;target&gt; for &lt;damage&gt;" in the combat log can be used. Heal
spells show up in the combat log as "Your &lt;spell&gt; heals
&lt;target&gt; for &lt;amount&gt;". A buff spell type shows up in the
combat log as "You gain &lt;spell&gt;".</li>
        <li>crit='yes' - Optional - If you set this parameter to yes,
this emote will only trigger when your damage or heal spell scores
critical on the target.</li>
      </ul>
&nbsp;As long as all the required parameters are set, and nothing bad
happens, SpellEmote will add your emote to the list, and will tell you
that it added your new emote.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="edit"></a>Editing an Emote</h2>
&nbsp;To edit an existing emote, you use the slash command /spellemote
edit<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;/spellemote edit spell='Spell Name' spelltype='damage/heal/buff'
(all other parameters are optional) text='Text to be said/emoted'
chance='0-100' emotetype='say/emote'<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>spell='Spell Name' - Required - Same as above, this is the
name of the spell or ability emote to edit. Obviously, it must already
exist in the SpellEmote list, also if the emote is specified for a
critical strike, the name will be "Spell Name Critical", example
"Mortal Strike Critical".</li>
        <li>spelltype='damage/heal/buff' - Required - Same as above,
which of the three types this emote exists under.</li>
        <li>text='Text to be said/emoted' - Optional - If specified,
this will replace whatever text is previously set for this emote.</li>
        <li>chance='0-100' - Optional - If specified, this will change
the percentage chance of this emote triggering.</li>
        <li>emotetype='say/emote' - Optional - You can change the
transmit type here, between say and emote.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="view"></a>Viewing an Emote</h2>
&nbsp;To view the list of emotes that SpellEmote has, or to view the
settings for a specific emote, use the slash command /spellemote view<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;/spellemote view spell='damage/heal/buff/all/Spell Name'<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>spell='damage/heal/buff/all/Spell Name' - Required - This
parameter is very flexible. You can enter "all" to view a list of all
SpellEmote emotes in all three categories. You can also set this to any
of the categories to view only emotes set in that category. For
example, /spellemote view spell='damage' would display a list of all
the damage emotes SpellEmote is looking for. You can also specify a
spell here, and SpellEmote will print all the options set for this
emote. If the same spell name exists in more than one of the spell type
categories, they will all be shown.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="delete"></a>Deleting an Emote</h2>
&nbsp;To delete an emote from SpellEmote, you use the slash command
/spellemote delete<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;/spellemote delete spell='Spell Name' (sometimes optional)
spelltype='damage/heal/buff'<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>spell='Spell Name' - Required - This is the name of the
spell emote to be deleted. If the emote is only found in one of the
categories, it will be removed. If the same emote name exists in
multiple categories, SpellEmote will ask you to specify which one to
delete by adding the spelltype parameter to the command.</li>
        <li>spelltype='damage/heal/buff' - If the same spell is found
in more than one category, this parameter is required.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="variables"></a>Text Substitution Variables</h2>
&nbsp;SpellEmote gives you several text substitution words you can use
in your text to spice up your spell text. For example, say you wish the
text for an emote type event to be "swings his axe at the enemy". If
the character you are playing is female however, the "his" is wrong.
You could re-write the text, or you could use one of these text
substitutions.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>(heshe) - This text will be replaced with the proper gender
term, "he" for males or "she" for females.</li>
        <li>(hishers) - This text will be replaced with the proper
gender term, "his" for males or "hers" for females.</li>
        <li>(himher) - This text will be replaced with the proper
gender term, "him" for males or "her" for females.</li>
        <li>(hisher) - This text will be replaced with the proper
gender term, "his" for males or "her" for females.</li>
        <li>(spelltarget) - This text will be replaced with the name of
thetarget of your spell or ability.</li>
      </ul>
&nbsp;So using these variables, you could re-write the text for the
previous example as "swings (hisher) axe at the enemy". If the
character played is female, the text would be transmitted as "/me
swings her axe at the enemy".<br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="examples"></a>Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>/spellemote add spell='Gouge' spelltype='damage'
text='strikes for the eyes' chance='20' emotetype='emote' - This
command would add a new emote for the rogue ability Gouge. 20% of the
time that the rogue sucessfully lands a gouge on an enemy, an emote
would be performed and would look like "* Sathanas strikes for the
eyes".</li>
        <li>/spellemote add spell='Aimed Shot' spelltype='damage'
text='Howd you like that (spelltarget)?!' chance='100' emotetype='say'
crit='yes' - This command adds an emote for the hunter ability Aimed
Shot. 100% of the time when the player scores a critical strike with
aimed shot, the player would /say the text, and the name of the
unfortunate victim would be appended for (spelltarget). It would look
something like "Scarlett says: Howd you like that Scarlet Invoker?!"</li>
        <li>/spellemote view spell='Gouge' - This command would display
the settings for the gouge ability in the first example. The user could
then decide if they wish to edit any of the options.</li>
        <li>/spellemote edit spell='Aimed Shot Critical'
spelltype='damage' chance='75' - This command would alter the chance of
the Aimed Shot example emote, making the text only said 75% of the time
that Aimed Shot scores a critical strike.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="warnings"></a>Warnings</h2>
&nbsp;Please keep these warnings in mind when using SpellEmote.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Area of Effect spells trigger any emotes set for that spell
for EVERY target struck. So for example, setting an emote to Arcane
Explosion with a chance of 100 is a VERY bad idea, as the emote will
trigger for every single target struck by the area of effect. This will
most likely get you automatically kicked off your realm by the flood
protection.</li>
        <li>Damage over time abilities trigger their emotes for every
tick of damage, which is every 3 seconds. For example, if you set an
emote for Shadow Word Pain with a chance of 100, the emote will trigger
every damage tick, causing quite a good deal of spam.<br>
