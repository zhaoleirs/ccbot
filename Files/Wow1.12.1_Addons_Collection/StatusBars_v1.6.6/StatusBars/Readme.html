<h1>StatusBars 1.6.6</h1>
<a href="mailto:wesslen@users.sourceforge.net">Daniel Wesslén</a>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>StatusBars adds bars to monitor health, mana, rage, energy,
combo points, debuffs and target/pet stats during combat (and whenever they are not fully charged / depleted).

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Health, mana, combo points, debuffs, etc visible at a glance.</li>
	<li>Bars fade in and out when needed, as defined by the user.</li>
	<li>Customizable bar and text colors, dependant on the current value.</li>
	<li>Customizable text - or none, whichever you prefer.</li>
	<li>Bars are draggable, but not by accident.</li>
	<li>Bars flash to draw attention to low stats.</li>
	<li>Can display mana in shifted form if DruidBar is also installed.</li>
	<li>Can display enemy health if MobHealth is also installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to replace the default player and target frames with StatusBars, I suggest you get the <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=1004">HideFrames</a> addon.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>Keep the shift key pressed and drag a bar to move the group it belongs to.
If the bars are locked you will have to type <tt>/statusbars unlock</tt> first.

<p>The behaviour can be controlled via the <tt>/statusbars</tt> slash command.

<pre>
  Syntax: /statusbars (lock|unlock)
  Syntax: /statusbars (load|save) (&lt;name&gt;|defaults)
  Syntax: /statusbars &lt;target&gt; &lt;option&gt; (&lt;value&gt|print|reset)
  Targets:
    all, player, target, pet, power, tpower, ppower,
    health, mana, rage, energy, focus, combo, druid, buff, debuff,
    thealth, tmana, trage, tenergy, tfocus, tdebuff, tbuff
    phealth, pmana, prage, penergy, pfocus, phappy, pbuff, pdebuff
  Options:
    alpha (decimal, default=1)
    enable (always/never/combat/combatonly/auto)
    color, tcolor, pcolor (string, see Readme.html)
    flash (on/off)
    group (player/target/pet/group1/group2/...)
    percentage (none/left/right)
    ptext (string, default = &frac%, see Readme.html)
    scale (decimal, default=1)
    text (string, see Readme.html or print the current value)
    warn (decimal, default=0.6)
</pre>

<p>Friendly buffs are hidden for the player and pet by default. To enable them, type
<pre>
  /statusbars buff enable combatonly
  /statusbars pbuff enable combatonly
</pre>

<p>To remove all buffs and debuffs, type
<pre>
  /statusbars buff enable never
  /statusbars debuff enable never
  /statusbars tbuff enable never
  /statusbars tdebuff enable never
  /statusbars pbuff enable never
  /statusbars pdebuff enable never
</pre>

<h4>Target</h4>
<p>The target determines in which bars the option is to be set.
Using <tt>all</tt> will set the value in all applicable bars,
using <tt>power</tt> or <tt>tpower</tt> will set the value in
the mana, rage, energy and focus bars.
<tt>player</tt> and <tt>target</tt> will set set value for all bars in the group.

<h4>Options</h4>
<table>
	<tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>alpha</tt>
		<td>Opacity of the bar. Decimal value between 0.0 and 1.0.
        Default = 1.0.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>enable</tt>
		<td>When the bar should be visible.<br>
         <tt>always</tt>, <tt>never</tt>: As expected<br>
         <tt>auto</tt>: When the current value differs from the default
               i.e. when damaged, when mana is not full, etc.<br>
         <tt>combat</tt>: As <tt>auto</tt>, but also displays when in combat.<br>
         <tt>combatonly</tt>: Only displays in combat, no matter what the value is.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>color</tt>, <tt>tcolor</tt>, <tt>pcolor</tt>
		<td>The color of the bar, text and percentage text.
			Can either be a simple named color (<tt>red</tt>, <tt>yellow</tt>, etc),
			a hexadecimal color in <tt>rgb</tt> or <tt>rrggbb</tt> format, or a <a href='#colexp'>color expression</a>.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>flash</tt>
		<td>If the bar should flash when high/low.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>group</tt>
		<td>Which group the bar should belong to. <tt>player</tt>, <tt>target</tt>, <tt>pet</tt> or one of the generic <tt>group1</tt>, <tt>group2</tt>...
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>percentage</tt>
		<td>Placement of the percentage display. <tt>none</tt>, <tt>left</tt> or <tt>right</tt>.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>ptext</tt>
		<td>Text to be displayed in the percentage field, subject to <a href='#text'>variable substitution</a>.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>scale</tt>
		<td>Scale the bar. Will only work well if all the bars in a group are set to the same scale.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>text</tt>
		<td>The text to be displayed in the bar, subject to <a href='#text'>variable substitution</a>.
	</tr><tr valign='top'>
		<td><tt>warn</tt>
		<td>Distance from the default value where the bar will
			start flashing if enabled.
			Default = 0.6, which represents 60%.
	</tr>
</table>

<h4>Option Management</h4>

<p> Options can be loaded, saved and reset using the commands <tt>/statusbars load &lt;name&gt;</tt>,
	<tt>/statusbars save &lt;name&gt;</tt> and <tt>/statusbars load defaults</tt>.
<p> You can use the name of another character to load or save the settings of that character,
	or use an arbitrary name to save settings for later reference.


<h4 id='text'>Text Variable Substitution</h4>

<p> The text to be displayed in the bar is subject to variable substitution;
	any occurences of <tt>&cur</tt>, <tt>&max</tt>, <tt>&frac</tt>, <tt>&-cur</tt>,
	<tt>&name</tt>, <tt>&rank</tt>, <tt>&class</tt>, <tt>&type</tt> and <tt>&lvl</tt>
	will be replaced with the current value, maximum value,
	current percentage, lost value, name, rank, class, type and level.

<p> This can be used to customize the information displayed in the bar.
	For example; if you do not like the percentage display
	but would like to see the target level and percentage next to the name in the
	target health bar, issue these commands:
<pre>
	/statusbars thealth percentage none
	/statusbars thealth text &name, &lvl (&frac%)
</pre>
	This will remove the percentage display and instead show
	text similar to "Defias Looter, 13 (43%)".

<p> If you would like to see the amount of health lost as well as amount left, use:
<pre>
	/statusbars thealth text &cur / &max (-&-cur)
</pre>
	This will show "580 / 700 (-120)".

<h4 id='colexp'>Color Expressions</h4>

<p>Color expressions are used to make the bar color dependant on
   the current value. The facility is perhaps best described by an example,
   the default health bar color is:
<pre>
	&lt;25%:red &lt;50%:orange &lt;75%:yellow green
</pre>
<p>This reads as "If health is lower than 25%, the bar is red. If health is
   below 50%, the bar is orange. If health is below 75%, the bar is yellow.
   Otherwise, the bar is green."

<p>The available conditions are <tt>=</tt>, <tt>!=</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;=</tt> and <tt>&gt;=.</tt>

<p>The value to test against can be either absolute or a percentage.

<p>Conditions are tested in order and the first one that matches will be selected,
   so make sure you list conditions in the reverse order they are expected to apply.
   The exception is the default color, which does not have a condition and is applied
   when no condition matches. Every color expression must have one and only one default color,
   and its placement is irrelevant.

<p>As a trivial example, the default mana bar color is:
<pre>
	blue
</pre>

<p>The following examples implement a request for functionality I got earlier: <br>
   <i>"Is there any way to color the combo bar.
   	  Like for 1/2 points it's red. 3/4 points it's yellow. 5 points it is green?"</i>
<pre>
	/statusbars combo color =5:green &gt;=3:yellow red
</pre>
   <i>"Energy bar: Could it be yellow if Energy &gt;= 40 (Sinister Strike),
   orange &gt;= 35 (Eviscerate), and red for Energy &lt; 35?"</i>
<pre>
	/statusbars energy color &lt;35:f00 &lt;40:ff8000 ff0
</pre>
   In the last example, colors were specified in hexadecimal <tt>rgb</tt> for illustration.
   You can use your favourite html color picker to find out the hex code for a color.

<p> If you start using complex color expressions I would suggest storing them in a macro
	so that you will not have to retype everything when making changes.
