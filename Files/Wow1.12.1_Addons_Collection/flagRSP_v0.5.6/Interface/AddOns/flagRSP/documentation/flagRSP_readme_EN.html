      to date information about flagRSP can always be found at the
      official homepage (<a

      <h2><a name="whatisit">What is flagRSP?</a></h2>
      
      <p>flagRSP is an addon (also known as UI customization) for the
      popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMORPG"
      target="_top">MMORPG</a> <a
      href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/" target="_top">World of
      Warcraft</a>. It's dedicated for roleplayers (please note that
      roleplaying means more than actually playing a roleplaying
      game). flagRSP adds several features to enhance and improve the
      roleplaying experience in WoW.</p>
      
      <p>flagRSP is based on <a
      href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=595"
      target="_top">xTooltip</a> by Peer 'Doxxan' L&ouml;nn Wege.
      This addon was changed by me to work on the German WoW client
      (see <a href="http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=732"
      target="_top">xTooltip2</a>). At the same time Zmrzlina began
      developing "flagRSP &amp; Friendlist". xTooltip2 and "flagRSP
      &amp; Friendlist" were merged together into "flagRSP &amp;
      Friendlist". After Zmrzlina has left WoW I am the current
      developer of this addon which is only called flagRSP to simplify
      matters.</p>

      <h3>flagRSP features</h3>
      
      <p>Here is an overview of the features flagRSP provides:</p>
      
      <div style="max-width: 50em;"><ul>
	  
	  <li>Set one of four <b>roleplaying flags</b> to show other players
	    your preffered roleplaying style. These flags will be visible
	    to other flagRSP users.</li>
	  
	  <li>Set one of four <b>character states</b> to show other players how
	    much in character you currently are, if you are searching for
	    contact or if you are trying to tell a story. </li>
	  
	  <li>Choose a <b>surname</b> and <b>title</b> for your
	    character that other users can see.</li>
	  
	  <li>Enter a <b>description</b> of the <b>outward
	      appearance</b> of your character that other users will be able
	    to see.</li>
	  
	  <li>An <b>enhanced Friendlist</b> with the possibility to add
	    players (of <b>both factions</b>), NPCs and even guilds.
	    <ul>
	      
	      <li>Choose several <b>categories</b> (currently "Friend", "Foe",
		"Known"; more will follow) for all entries.</li>
	      
	      <li>Add detailed <b>notes</b> containing of multiple lines
		for each entry.</li>
	      
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li><b>Hide names</b> of unknown players and <b>replace exact
	      level information</b> of all units by relative ones (from
	    "extremely puny" to "hopelessly superior"). Both options are
	    optional! </li>
	  
	  <li>Character settings (surname, title, description, RP flag,
	    character state) can be configured via <b>GUI</b>. More
	    graphic dialogs will follow.</li>
	  
	  <li><b>Completely localized</b> in <b>English</b> and
	    <b>German</b>. Also fully compatible with the <b>French</b>
	    WoW client (flagRSP itself will be English on French
	    client). </li>
	  
	  <li><b>Load on demand</b> capability. flagRSP contains a
	  small helper addon flagRSPLoader that manages loading of
	  flagRSP in general, for specific realms and characters. Can
	  be configured to use flagRSP only for certain
	  characters/realms.</li>
	  
	  <li>Every feature is <b>optional</b>.</li>
	  
	</ul></div>
      
      <h2><a name="installation">Installation instructions</a></h2>

      <p>Installation of flagRSP is simple. Just extract the ZIP file
	into your World of Warcraft directory (be sure to extract the
	folder structure as well and not only the plain files) or select
	your World of Warcraft directory for the installer. After this
	the addons should work.</p>

      <p>There should be a message that flagRSP is initializing in
	game in your chat window. After approximately one minute there
	should be another message that flagRSP has been
	initialized. Furthermore there should be a button for Friendlist
	near the minimap.</p>
      
      <p>If anything goes wrong be sure to check the FAQ first. Most
	install problems can be solved easily.</p>

      <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Normally the following step should be
	unnecessary. Unfortunately this does not work occasionally for
	unknown reasons.</p>

      <p>After installation you have to check if flagRSP could
	properly join the chat channel "xTensionXTooltip2". Normally
	this should happen automatically <b>after one or two minutes</b>
	(after flagRSP says it is initialized). However, under unknown
	circumstances (mostly in context with Cosmos) this occasionally
	failes.</p>

      <p>Therefore, move your mouse pointer into you main chat frame
	so that the tab "General" becomes visible. Right click on this
	to open the menu. Under the point "Channels" should be a list of
	all active chat channels.</p>

      <p>In this list there should be "xTensionXTooltip2" (perhaps in
	lower case). <b>If this is not the case you have to manually join
	this channel.</b> To do so enter this command:</p>

      <p>/join xTensionXTooltip2</p>

      <p>After this the channel should appear in the list even after
	restarting the game.</p>

      <h3>Some notes about preview releases</h3>
      
      <p>Some versions of flagRSP are preview releases or release
      candidates. Please pay attention to the following notes if using
      such a release:</p>

      <div style="max-width: 50em;"><ul>
	  
	  <li>If you just want to use flagRSP without having problems
	    please do not use these versions. Use the more stable normal
	    releases instead.</li>
	  
	  <li>Preview releases can be EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. There
	    will definitely be bugs in these releases. Perhaps these
	    bugs will not affect you, perhaps they will. I release these
	    preview releases to give brave users the possibility to test
	    the newest bleeding edge features.</li>

	  <li>There will (perhaps) be features that do not work yet
	    (i.e. buttons that do nothing etc.). If you think you have
	    discovered a bug please check the changelog first. Perhaps
	    the feature has just not been implemented and thus certainly
	    won't work.</li>

	  <li>If you use a preview release and discover a bug, please
	    report it! The intention of these releases is to find
	    bugs. Some bugs do never appear for me. Only by receiving
	    bug reports I can develop more stable versions.</li>

	</ul></div>
	  
      <h2><a name="safety">Safety</a></h2>

      <p><b>This point is very important!</b> flagRSP has no ability
	to write down its own data into a separate file. Therefore,
	flagRSP CANNOT make backups of any settings you made and more
	important backups of your Friendlist entries and your personal
	description!</p>

      <p>flagRSP can tell WoW which data it should save for
	flagRSP. However, WoW might instantly delete this data if
	anything goes wrong (WoW crashes, bugs etc.).</p>

      <p>However, losing your Friendlist entries or your description
	because WoW or flagRSP got something wrong can be very
	painful. Therefore you should backup these settings as often as
	possible!</p>

      <p>How to backup your settings: Look into your WoW
      directory. There should be a subdirectory called WTF. Follow the
      path "WTF\Account\&lt;your accountname&gt;\SavedVariables\". In this
      directory there should be several .lua and .lua.bak files. For
      flagRSP you will need flagRSP.lua, flagRSPLoader.lua and
      Friendlist.lua. Take these files and copy them to a location
      where they are safe.</p>

      <p>In case of anything going wrong (e.g. WoW deleting your
	settings) you can simply copy the backup files back into this
	directory.</p>
      
    <h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
    
    <p>My goal is to make flagRSP as easy to use as possible. Most
      features are self-explanatory. However, there is still no
      configuration GUI available. Therefore you need command line
      options to configure some parts of flagRSP.</p>
    
    <p>The command line options of flagRSP can be accessed by entering "/rsp" respectively "/fl" on
      your chat prompt. Here is an overview of the available command
      line options.</p>
