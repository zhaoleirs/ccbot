## Notes: This mod will cancel a heal if the unit's health is less then the threshold healed and the spell has less then the desired casting time remaining. Note that the unit does not have to be selected, but must be in your raid/party. Also note that it will only check/cancel a heal everytime a 'Check Current Heal' key is pressed.
